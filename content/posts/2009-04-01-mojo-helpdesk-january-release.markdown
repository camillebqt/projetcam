We've been busy upgrading Mojo Helpdesk. Here is what we have done:  
  
Bye spammers!   
We added an anti-spam feature so we only get requests from real people.  
  
Better email notifications  
We improved our subscription options so tech staff gets only what's wanted.  
  
API improvements  
You can now import or export users from the API in any languages like Perl, PHP, Java, VB or Ruby.  
  
Improved ticket management efficiency  
We added actions you can apply on several tickets at a time.  
  
And there are more improvements. Check them out  at [http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blogwiki.metadot.net](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blogwiki.metadot.net/).
