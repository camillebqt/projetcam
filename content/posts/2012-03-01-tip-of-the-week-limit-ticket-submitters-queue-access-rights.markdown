Did you know that you can control what queues ticket submitters can view? This can be very important when providing service internally as not all departments should have access to other departments' ticket queues. It can also be used to set up internal queues that need to remain invisible to individual customers and other companies.







To set this up, you'll need to first create companies for each department/company you service and edit users so they are associated with the company. Most companies will already have set this up when configuring their helpdesk space. In addition, Mojo Helpdesk comes with a company already created called Individuals that any individual ticket submitters are filtered into automatically.







Once you have your companies set up, go to the all settings link and select Queue Access Rights from the Managers column. You'll see a list of the companies you have set up with the queues they have access to. To set the queues available to each company, click the change link and check the boxes next to the queues you want them to be able to view. Click save and you are done.







Now users will only be able to submit tickets to the queues they have access to.
