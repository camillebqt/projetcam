Mojo currently adds cc'd recipients to the reply messages automatically, but with this new release you have the option to change this behavior. Go to Admin -> Helpdesk Configuration, then under "Email Settings" you will find the setting to "Reply all by default." Turn this "off" if you do not want Mojo to automatically reply to all cc'd recipients.
