Mojo Helpdesk has added a new feature that lets organizations determine which users and help desk staff are able to create tickets. We've paired this with our [group access feature](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2013/08/reply-all.html) so that some users can be permitted to read & comment on tickets but not be able to open or close tickets.

The default setting allows all users and help desk staff to create tickets. If you want to disable a user's ability to create tickets, here are the steps.


### Turn off the ability for a user to create tickets:


Click **manage** >> click **Users** or **Helpdesk staff **from the drop-down menu >> find the person in the list >> click **edit** >> Deselect the check box for **Can create tickets >> **click** save**
