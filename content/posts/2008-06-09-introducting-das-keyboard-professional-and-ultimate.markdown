It's official! The third generation of Das Keyboard is now available for pre-order at [www.daskeyboard.com](http://www.daskeyboard.com/). The new Das Keyboard is a complete redesign that focuses on providing the best typing experience. I think we succeeded but our users will have the final word on this. 

  


The new Das keyboard comes in two models: 

  * Das Keyboard Ultimate: the blank mechanical keyboard
  * Das Keyboard Professional: with inscriptions
Here are some feature highlights:  


  * Mechanical key switches
  * USB hub
  * Blue LEDs
  * Glossy black enclosure
  * extra long USB cable

Check it out at [www.daskeyboard.com](http://www.daskeyboard.com/).
