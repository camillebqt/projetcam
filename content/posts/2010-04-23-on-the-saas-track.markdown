MARKET TRENDS: According to a BizTechReports survey conducted in 2009, SaaS, which stands for Software as a Service but also known as on-demand software, was sparking a serious interest from organizations with no exception to the ones with already established customer support infrastructures.

Economic downturn, challenges of generating new revenue and pressure to reduce operational costs have contributed to a new priority for businesses in 2010: customer retention. Businesses now more than ever are setting their sights on providing outstanding customer service and are turning to SaaS applications to meet this requirement.

The newest industries to utilize software as a service include Manufacturing, Construction, Financial Services, Retail, Government Agencies, Education, Telecommunications, Transportation, Legal and Real Estate. According to Information Week, one fourth of SaaS customers are moving beyond sales force automation and using web based apps in areas such as human resource management, internal & customer support, and financial management.

Organizations jumping on board consider the many benefits of using software as a service. The on demand element provides start-up, support and service in just a few clicks without the need to download anything or own any software and server licenses-ever. Most SaaS applications, are prepared to provide all the training necessary to learn the application at no extra charge to the organization.

But if that's not reason enough, SaaS models like Mojo Helpdesk, eliminate the risk and responsibility associated with operational issues, backups, updates, and the dependence on costly internal or external IT maintenance is virtually non-existent.
