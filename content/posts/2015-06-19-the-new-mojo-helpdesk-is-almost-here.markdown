We recently shared exciting news that the new Mojo Helpdesk was right around the corner. Now, we're excited to announce that we will be launching on Monday. The Mojo developers have been working behind the scenes to create a completely new and user-friendly UI for your business. The new and improved Mojo Helpdesk will bring a whole new level of simplicity right to your desk.


### What's New





	
  * A brand new, easy-to-use ticketing experience.

	
  * Super Fast Single Page Application with zero delays.

	
  * Responsive interface to adjust to all devices.

	
  * Awesome new look that will have you smiling.

	
  * New Capabilities in My Assignments.







If at any time you want to switch back to the current Mojo Helpdesk, the good news is, it's only one click away. Not to mention, there will be no change for the end user, your customers won't even notice the slightest change.
