In one word: Great.

Windows 7 has been available in its pre-release form (called RC: release candidate). After few days of test we can say that Windows 7 is a huge improvement for people running Vista and a great one for those running XP. The installation is a breeze, everything works right away. Things you will first notice when you run Windows 7:



	
  * Windows 7 is very stable and **_fast_** even on old hardware.

	
  * The interface is clean and elegant.

	
  * Windows 7 in non intrusive. The OS stays where it should be: in the background, leaving the user in a one to one relationship with their work.

	
  * The Windows Live apps are, partly, Microsoft’s answer to Apple iLife.


If you have the opportunity to get your hands on Windows 7 RC it is worth a try.
