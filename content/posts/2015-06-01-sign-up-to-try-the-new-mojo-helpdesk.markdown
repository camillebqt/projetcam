We recently announced that Mojo Helpdesk is being completely redone from the ground up.  We are now excited to share that private beta testing has officially begun! We invited a few Mojo customers to be the first to try the Mojo Helpdesk and give us their feedback.


Here’s some feedback we’ve gotten so far….


<blockquote>** **“I love the new Mojo, it's definitely a step up and is really making a difference in my work day!”</blockquote>


** **As the second stage of beta testing, we would like to invite YOU to try out the new Mojo Helpdesk. It’ll give you a chance to experience the new Mojo Helpdesk firsthand and you can also see why we’re so excited to get this in front of you. The great part is, if you need to switch to the current Mojo Helpdesk at any time during testing, you can easily do that...not that we think you’ll want to. Also, there's no change for the end user, so your customers won't know anything has changed.

** **If you’re interested in trying out the new Mojo Helpdesk, please [contact us](https://help.mojohelpdesk.com/mytickets/create#/ticket-form/22393) and we’ll get you setup. Also, stay tuned for more information to come about the new Mojo Helpdesk, we’ll be sending regular updates leading up to the launch to keep you informed. So be sure to follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MojoHelpdesk)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mojohelpdesk), that’s where we’ll be announcing the awesome things to come.
