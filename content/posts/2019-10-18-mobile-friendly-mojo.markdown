This release makes Mojo easier to use on a mobile platform.







  * A vertical menu displays the main navigation to the helpdesk settings and ticket lists. The menu allows ticket search and the creation of a new ticket.





  * This menu slides open and closes on any screen.

The ticket details view is split into two separate views:







  * The ticket details view (ticket title, description, comments)





  * The ticket fields view (system fields, custom fields, timestamps, and attachments)

  * Margins and padding have been tweaked to make the views visually appealing and to improve usability.





  * Mobile platforms can be slower than desktop so we've added visual feedback during time-consuming actions.





  * Tactile zoom is suppressed in order to always keep a coherent visual display.





  * We hope these improvements make the Mojo experience even better on any mobile device.
