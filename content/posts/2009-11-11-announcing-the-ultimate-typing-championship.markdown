How fast can you type? Do you think you’re fast enough to be the _Ultimate Typing Champion_?<!-- more -->

![4094192546_5d2cd06f3f_o](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/4094192546_5d2cd06f3f_o.jpg)

_Now you can prove it._

If the title isn’t enough for you, perhaps $2,000, a free trip to [South by Southwest](http://www.sxsw.com/) in Austin, TX, a free keyboard, or a few other prizes will entice you to compete.

Today we launch the Ultimate Typing Championship. At its core is TyprX, a multi-player typing game that allows players to race in real time over the internet. The idea is to help you show off your mad typing skills and/or to increase your typing speed. TyprX will keep track of all your scores from when you’re signed in and enter you in the Championship.

Check it out at [www.UltimateTypingChampionship.com](http://www.ultimatetypingchampionship.com/).
