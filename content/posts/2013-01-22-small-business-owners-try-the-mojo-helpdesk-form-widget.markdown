Have you tried the Mojo Helpdesk form widget?<!-- more -->

The form widget places a small tab on your website that visitors can press to access a simple ticket submission form. It's perfect for organizations looking to add a 'Contact Us' or 'Get Support' button to their home page.





To use the form widget, select **'manage >>all settings'** from the Mojo Helpdesk navigation menu, then look under the **'Owner/Admin'** column and click the **'Form widget'** link. The link will take you to a page where you can customize the tab and form. Follow the simple instructions to copy & paste the resulting code to your web page(s) and then site visitors can use the form to submit tickets to the queue of your choice.
