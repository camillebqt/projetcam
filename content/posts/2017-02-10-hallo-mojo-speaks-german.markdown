We are extremely excited to announce that the German language is now available in Mojo Helpdesk.Â Next to come is Portuguese and Italian.

You can configure the German language for your helpdesk interface by going to Admin Settings -> Helpdesk Configuration. Here you will set the language for the account. Individual users can choose to change the language in their interface by going to their user profile and selecting the language there.

Auf Wiedersehen
