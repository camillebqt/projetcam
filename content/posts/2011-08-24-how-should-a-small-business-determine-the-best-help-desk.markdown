Virtually all businesses have employees that use a computer for some task or another. Computers make a variety of jobs easier, and in today’s tech rich world, they are almost a necessity. Just like with all things technical, computers malfunction or simply outwit their users. For these and other reasons, companies have help desk services to aid their employees in solving IT related issues. Small businesses must determine what the best help desk program should be for their needs based on the activities of their employees, the complexity of the network as well as the budget allotted for the system.


### Who, What, Where and When?


Many software packages are great for dedicated computers and even laptops that rove around a building. Many businesses however, have employees that work remotely or perform tasks from mobile devices or laptops in places other than the company campus. The help desk software that a company chooses should be equally as mobile and flexible enough to handle requests coming in from devices other than computers. Employees working remotely will still need occasional assistance with devices and will need answers quickly.


### Multi-tech environments


These days, employees may have the option of choosing from different machines, such as PC’s or Macintoshes. They may also be running differing versions of operating systems on these machines, as well as various types of software, depending on their job descriptions. This can make solving issues incredibly complex and downright confusing for help desk solutions. Ensuring that the software a company purchases can handle multi-tech environments such as these is crucial to its success.


### Price


Of course price can be a driving factor in a poor economic climate even when businesses do not want it to be. Help desk programs generally charge for the license to use the product, which can be anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Just because a system is expensive, however, does not mean that it is better for your company’s particular needs. The best help desk will be a combination of what works for the company at a competitive price.

Computers and other technology that we use in our daily work lives seem to be a mainstay. Although these machines make a lot of tasks much easier, they also tend to need fixing or expertise that a user may not have. Help desk software helps users by tracking issue requests and acting as a knowledge base for IT related problems that employees face.
