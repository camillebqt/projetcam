Branding might seem a concept that falls more into the realm of marketing than customer service, but smart business people know that the two are highly interrelated. The main goals of a helpdesk are to bring greater efficiency to the customer support process and improve the quality of each customer service experience, but [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) offers the added benefit of customization options to help ensure that the exceptional customer service offered is consistently tied into the company’s brand in the minds of customers.







Any business that has invested in the proper resources and training to provide outstanding customer service should be eager to make sure that those positive customer service experiences are associated with the company at every step. By incorporating company branding into the helpdesk, customers are regularly reminded of the company while working with the customer service representative, and will therefore be more likely to recall their positive customer support experiences when it comes time to consider future purchases.







Helpdesk branding also provides regular customers extra confidence that their problem will be resolved, when the company's customer support carries the same branded seal of approval as the products they already know and love. As more and more larger businesses outsource their customer service to companies with little actual connection to the business and products they represent, providing an explicit visual connection between the customer service experience and the company can make a huge difference in ensuring that the customer has a positive experience.




 




There are several simple options available to more clearly tie a company’s brand to the customer experience in [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/):








	
  * All [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) customers receive a branded URL to direct users to the helpdesk (_http://yourbrand.mojohelpdesk.com_)

	
  * Include one or more links back to your website in the main customer portal. Providing a link to an FAQ’s page could help customers find the answers they need before submitting a ticket. As an added benefit, this will increase your website’s SEO

	
  *  Add the company logo on the customer portal mainpage

	
  * Customize the copy included in the portal mainpage and the e-mails sent from within the helpdesk to add your company’s unique voice and writing style that your customers are already familiar with 


In addition to these simple branding options, the customer portal mainpage is also fully customizable with HTML.  Any company with an html savvy designer can get creative in finding new ways to incorporate branding and other relevant information into this space.  Use it to keep customers up to date on company and product news, current promotions, marketing materials like videos or whitepapers, and anything else a current customer might find valuable. 


 




Business owners and managers should always be on the lookout for ways to make the most out of the resources at a company’s disposal. [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) makes it easy to use a tool designed for improving customer service to also further the company’s brand.
