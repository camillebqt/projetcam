We're excited to announce the newest Mojo feature: **knowledge base article ratings**. Now your users can rate the helpfulness of your knowledge base articles in one click.

We store the ratings so you can see which articles are delivering insight and which articles might need more detailed information in order to answer your users' questions.

The knowledge base ratings are enabled by default when you turn on your [knowledge base](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2013/08/help-desk-knowledge-base.html).  If you have any questions about this new feature, please feel free to [contact us](https://help.mojohelpdesk.com/).
