We are proud to announce the release of our new streamlined [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) website and logo. Our updated branding reflects our intuitive, efficient and user-friendly design. We have consolidated our pricing plans by removing our Free and Basic plans, and have packed more features into our Enterprise plans. Now customers can choose monthly invoicing as well as secure their subscription with a Purchase Order. Along with our new site, we have updated the [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) UI by improving accessibility to account information in the Owner/Admin menu. The new Account Information section allows users to easily update their billing information, view or change plans, and view their billing statement. It also provides an easier way for customers to subscribe to a plan when their free trial period ends.
There are other ways to stay in-touch and informed about [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) news. Check out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MojoHelpdesk) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mojohelpdesk).
