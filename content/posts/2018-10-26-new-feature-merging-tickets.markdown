The ability to merge tickets is now available in Mojo Helpdesk.Â  Ticket merge allows agents to group tickets together to cut down on redundancy and remedy ticket duplication. Let's say you receive a ticket and the user accidentally submits a response to that ticket as a new ticket. Now you can merge the ticket with the original and it will automatically close out the merged ticket.

As the tickets merge, a comment can be added to the tickets to let the user and agent know what has happened.

Or let's say a user submits 5 tickets for the same issue (a little inpatient, perhaps) now an agent can select all the tickets and combine them into one ticket. Essentially, this closes the other tickets and adds a comment to the closed tickets.
