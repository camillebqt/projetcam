Its our priority to make sure that [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) performs with the highest efficiency for our customers. Over the past 6 months we've been working extra hard to provide the highest quality services. Though a lot of the work we've done has been "behind the curtain" (to improve speed and efficiency), there are several feature requests that we also took to heart and implemented:

**Everything is Faster:**








	
  * Report rendering is faster.

	
  * Time-spent reports load faster and now include a report for closed tickets.

	
  * Automations have been debugged improving overall performance.




**Increased Organization and Preferences:**











	
  * Agents can add user's contact info, ticket type, and additional custom information to email notifications.

	
  * Agents have the option to send (or not send) the Welcome Email when creating a ticket. 

	
  * There is an option in settings to keep pages out of Search Engine Indexes (for portals that want to stay private).










**Automatic Data Entry:**








	
  * Mojo Helpdesk instantly recognizes and populates first and last names associated with each user's email.

	
  * Automatic time zones default to the agent's time zone (this can be changed in the user's profile).







**Our Search Engines Have Improved:**








	
  * Agents can perform the combined search of "Solved and Closed" tickets (rather than only one or the other).

	
  * International characters are recognized in the search field.










**Improved Audit Trail:**








	
  * The event log has been optimized and now tracks more changes, like when a staff member makes a change to a custom field.



















As you can tell, we have been busy. Our goal is to be the most efficient ticket-tracking service for customer and tech support, which is an on-going process that we are dedicated to uphold. We have several other features that will be rolling out in the weeks, and months to come, so stay tuned for further updates.
