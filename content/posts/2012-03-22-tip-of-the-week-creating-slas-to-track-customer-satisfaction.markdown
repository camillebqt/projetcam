Service Level Agreements help organizations measure response time and customer satisfaction. Defining SLA targets is a simple feature to set up in Mojo Helpdesk and can help you set goals and track your support team’s success.

To set up SLA’s in Mojo Helpdesk click the SLA link from the Manage drop down menu. Click the new button and then fill out the information for your SLA target. Each SLA can measure either response time or customer satisfaction. Determine the goal for your SLA and the compliance conditions for the SLA. The goal will be the percentage of tickets that meet the Compliance Conditions you determine.

You can then filter the tickets by type, specific companies, selected technicians and queues, before saving the SLA target. This can be useful if a company requires you to reach a certain SLA level when providing support and you want to create an SLA specifically for them. 

Now that you’ve created your SLA, you’ll want to run periodic reports to track your team. Click the run reports button on the SLA targets page, select the time period and type of report to run and Mojo Helpdesk will generate a chart along with the current stats for your SLA. These are great for setting up incentives for your support team to increase their stats.
