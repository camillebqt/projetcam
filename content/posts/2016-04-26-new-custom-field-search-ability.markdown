With Mojo Helpdesk's latest release you will notice some new filters in the advanced search area. You are now able to search for tickets or create ticket views based on custom fields. For example, say you added a custom field for 'location' on your ticket form with the values being Chicago, Boston, and Austin.  If you click on the advanced search and choose the filter for 'Custom Field' you can choose 'location = Boston'. You will also be able to perform multiple custom field searches so you could search for 'location = Boston' and 'location = Austin' in one search, just by adding another custom field filter.
