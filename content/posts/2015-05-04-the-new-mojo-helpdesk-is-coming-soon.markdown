We’re excited to announce that Mojo Helpdesk is being completely redone from the ground up. The Mojo gurus have been working behind the scenes to develop the next generation of Mojo Helpdesk to make it even more user friendly. Well, we’re happy to share that they have masterfully taken “simple” to the next level.Here’s what you can expect with the new Mojo Helpdesk:

While the current user interface is easy to use with basic functionality, we felt as though it could use a complete renovation, and that is exactly what we did. The new Mojo Helpdesk experience will have a new up-to-date modern functionality that's super fast and incredibly easy.

Here’s just a few of the changes we’d like to share:


### Super Fast Single Page Application


No waiting, no delays. The new Mojo Helpdesk is lighting fast so you can move as quickly as you need to.


### Responsive Interface


The new design makes it easier to use Mojo Helpdesk on any type of device. You can easily view your help desk without having to adjust any setting or zoom in and out to navigate the system.


### New Capabilities in My Assignments


You can now filter by status and queue, sort by the date a ticket was created, last updated, and based on priority. Another great new feature is the ability to quickly comment on tickets in bulk that require the same response.


### A New Look That Will Have You Smiling


Whether you’re enjoying the new customizable views, dashboard, easy to view admin section, or awesome video clips (you might run into from time to time), Mojo’s new up-to-date interface will put a smile on your face.Here are some images of the new Mojo Helpdesk (in development and still evolving), but we couldn't wait to share some exciting stuff that's in the works...




### New Dashboard
