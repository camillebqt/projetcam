All Mojo Helpdesk users can now copy someone when creating a new ticket. Previously, the CC field was only available on follow up messages.Also, we added the view of the cc'd users on the actual ticket, so the agent can see who was cc'd when the ticket was created. This way, an agent can include those recipients on any future correspondence.







Have a Merry Christmas.
