One of the great features of Mojo Helpdesk is the ability to customize the Customer Portal home page. When you first visit the page, you'll notice several areas mentioning Mojo Helpdesk. Whether you want to go all out and change the body text with HTML formatted content, or just insert your logo and change the corporate name, you can easily replace these areas with a few clicks of the mouse and a little bit of text.





We highly recommend you make these changes so your customers know they are working with you to fix whatever issue or question they have. The changes may seem small, but the end result will be a much more professional customer portal. Check out our video and learn how to make these changes so you can personalize Mojo Helpdesk. We think you'll love the end result.
