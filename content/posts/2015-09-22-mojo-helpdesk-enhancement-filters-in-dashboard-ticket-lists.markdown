Today we released a new filter for the ticket lists: ticket types. Now you can filter ticket lists by status, queue and/or type.

We also added filters to the dashboard report so that data can be drilled down by ticket queues or ticket types. This enhancement allows you to see how many tickets were created and closed within a specific period for a specific queue or type. For example, if you need to see the dashboard metrics for the 'Applications' queue that areÂ of the 'Reset Password' type, the new filters will allow you to see this at a glance.
