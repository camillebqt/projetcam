We are excited to announce the [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) feature is now available as a subscribed add-on in Mojo Helpdesk.



























With [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) you can track all your organization's assets in one central location. An asset is defined as anything of value within a company such as hardware, software licenses, vehicles, contracts and even employees. With [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/), you can add and view important data based on the assets such as whether the asset is in use, available or retired, who the asset is used by, the department and location it's assigned to, as well as, other details such as purchase date, purchase price and warranty information.

The [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) feature is perfect for an IT team to use in combination with the helpdesk so they can create tickets to troubleshoot device related issues or request forms to check in and out devices - almost like a library system.

Or a maintenance team can use it to keep track of service equipment.







Another example, a transportation department could use [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) to manage their fleet vehicles and have automatic tickets created based on routine vehicle maintenance schedules.







Once you add assets to Mojo and apply the asset to a user, the user will then be able to choose which asset they are referring to when submitting a ticket. This makes for easier ticket resolution and tracking of issues per asset.

























We hope you enjoy the [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) feature. For setting up [Asset Management](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/asset-management/) in Mojo please view our knowledge base articles.
