The [Mojo Helpdesk website](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) has a new skin! The new design conveys more clearly what the Mojo Helpdesk is about: simple ticket tracking that helps organizations efficiently manage customer and employee requests. In Mojo Helpdesk requests are centralized and assigned, therefore nothing is dropped and customers have their requests answered. They are happy. Your staff is happy. This is what "getting your Mojo back" is about.
