We recently reached out to our customers who work in schools, universities, and other educational institutions to hear their thoughts on Mojo Helpdesk.   
  
They reported that **24/7 accessibility**, **out-of-the-box email integration**, **Google Apps integration**, and **affordability** were the key reasons they chose Mojo Helpdesk as their ticket tracking system. You can read the full story [here](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2013/03/the-top-4-reasons-schools-and.html).   
  
In this blog, we follow up with a few excerpts from the stories we received.  
  
Enjoy:

_"Before Mojo Helpdesk, we did not have a tracking program other than the list I carried in my back pocket which was known as the Butt List! Now Mojo Helpdesk is used by all of our faculty and administration from kindergarten through 8th grade. _







_The work does not go away but now everyone knows how much work you are doing and cuts you a little more slack... not much, but it helps!"_

_"I can be OCD when it comes to messages and trying to keep conversations organized, Mojo Helpdesk allows me to stay organized, on track with my requests and free of clutter which allows me to work more effectively and cover more ground every day. __I like the simplicity of using Mojo Helpdesk. I had a good idea of what I was looking for in a product, and Mojo Helpdesk was everything I needed and more."_

_"Mojo was the answer for us! We use it exclusively for IT help desk support and will be rolling it out to school maintenance departments over the summer. It integrates perfectly with Google Apps for Education, it's 100% cloud-based, and it's a small fraction of the cost."_ - Greg
