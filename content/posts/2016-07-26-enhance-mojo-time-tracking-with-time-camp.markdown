We’re happy to announce that Mojo Helpdesk now integrates with TimeCamp time tracking software through Zapier.  Although Mojo supports [automatic time tracking](https://www.timecamp.com/) and time spent reporting on tickets, this integration could enhance the time tracking functionality by tracking billable time and then invoicing directly from TimeCamp. TimeCamp would also allow you to separately track agent's attendance and time off for reporting on the burden of time and workable time.

When the integration is made through Zapier, new TimeCamp projects and tasks will be created from new Mojo tickets.  TimeCamp then allows you to track the time spent on the project or task that was created from the Mojo ticket.
