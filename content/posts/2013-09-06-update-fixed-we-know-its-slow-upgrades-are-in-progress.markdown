Mojo Helpdesk has been upgraded. Everything is running smoothly. Thank you for your patience. Mojo Helpdesk has been very slow the last few days. We understand the frustrations our users are experiencing.

To fix the problem, **we are upgrading our search engine**. We are working as fast as possible and will have Mojo running smoothly by Tuesday, September 10th.

During this upgrade, new tickets may be slow to appear in your helpdesk.

Thanks for your patience.
