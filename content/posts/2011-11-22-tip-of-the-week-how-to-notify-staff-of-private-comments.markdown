Often, it is necessary to contact another employee within the company to get help solving a customer's issue. One of Mojo Helpdesk's features is the ability to add a private message to the ticket so staff can work together on a ticket without their communications being visible to the customer.


In order to ensure staff are notified when private messaging, it is best to 're-assign' the ticket first, then add the private message. The new assignee will not only receive an email notification about the ticket update,Â but also notification a comment was added. If you just add a private message to a ticket without re-assigning it, no one will know about the private message. Once the assignee is done, they can re-assign the ticket back to the original ticket owner for follow up with ticket closure.
