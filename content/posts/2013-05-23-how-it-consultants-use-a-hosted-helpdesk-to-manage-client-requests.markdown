Married in 2003 when MoonRivers Media was in its early stages they worked tirelessly to build a client base and launch the business in 2004. Now nine years later, they're thriving entrepreneurs who serve a clientele of small to mid sized companies in the New England area and nationwide.







When not providing IT expertise to their clients, Mark and Melissa are also avid outdoors people who enjoy skiing and spending time with their two kids.





They were kind of enough to take some time out of their schedule to chat with us about their business and how it integrates with our [hosted helpdesk software](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/).

**ENTER MARK AND MELISSA:**







### Tell us about MoonRivers Media.







From web hosting, to email marketing, to Google Apps integration, MoonRivers Media offers an array of technology solutions for clients in the New England area and nationwide. The nature of our company is very mobile/on the road and the majority of hours are spent on site at client's offices, not our own. MoonRivers Media experienced a big growth once we settled at our home in New Hampshire and built a client base of local small to mid size companies with IT support needs.










### What challenges you were facing prior to using Mojo?







Our diverse client base is spread around the country and our clients come to us for support 24/7. We needed to centralize the management of the requests and we needed a help desk to be bullet proof and accessible from EVERYWHERE.







### How do you use Mojo day to day?







Tickets come in via email to help@moonrivers.com and our techs can grab them and get to work. It also integrates with our existing site and Google Apps both of which were great for us.







### Tell us about the results.







We can search the tickets for answers to questions people submit again and again. We can show them how to self-help and login to their own custom profile with all their tickets.







We also get the original requests via email and then the help@moonriver address sends the tickets to a few email boxes and to the helpdesk so we can see them every which way and respond as appropriate.







We combined the helpdesk with our remote software support and now we have a GREAT helpdesk.
