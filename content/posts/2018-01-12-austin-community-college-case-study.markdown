The Mojo Helpdesk team recently caught up with Mike Hill, the Director of Campus Technology Services of Austin Community College, to see how they were using Mojo Helpdesk to improve process efficiency, decrease costs, and increase user satisfaction. Austin Community College is a nationally recognized two-year college serving 43,000 students. Mike told us how Mojo Helpdesk helped him overcome challenges that he had with his previous helpdesk implementation. Here are the highlights of the case study:



 	
  * **Challenge:** Help desk staff was facing constant reorganizations and the workflow changes were slow and costly to implement.

 	
  * **Solution:** Mojo Helpdesk provided a risk-free and cost-effective solution that is flexible to handle the evolving needs.

 	
  * **Results:** Help desk efficiency has increased, allowing Austin Community College to _decrease costs_.
