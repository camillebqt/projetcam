Once a company finds the perfect fit to join the customer service team, the first few days and weeks on the job are a crucial period for equipping the new hire with the knowledge needed to be an exceptional customer service representative. The best method for customer service training is to let trainees spend their first couple of days watching an experienced member of the team. Through shadowing an expert, the new hire will learn the systems, policies, how to utilize essential tools like [the helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) that are in regular use, and be able to ask questions.


During the initial training period, there are a five key lessons that should be covered before your new hire begins to work directly with your customers:

**1. How to Handle an Angry Customer**
It’s inevitable that a customer service representative will encounter angry customers in the course of performing the job. Keep these suggestions in mind and consider doing some role-playing to give the new hire a chance to practice giving measured, calm responses on the fly.

**2. Avoid Saying “I don’t know”**
While no one expects a customer service representative to know everything, there are better ways to express uncertainty than “I don’t know.” Teach the trainee some alternate phrases to use, such as:



	
  * “Let me look into that for you.”

	
  * “I’m not entirely certain, I’ll find out more and get back to you.”

	
  * “I’d like to do some research to give you the most informative response.”


This way, one avoids providing inaccurate information, while also showing a willingness to give the best response possible.

**3. The Importance of Listening**
To help solve a problem, it’s necessary to first understand it. Errors are likely if this important first step is skipped. Emphasize how crucial it is to avoid making assumptions about a customer’s issue before hearing the full explanation. If there is not a clear picture, be sure your employee knows how to ask the right questions to get all information needed to properly move forward.

**4. How to Apologize**
Everyone makes mistakes and it stands to reason that there will be times when the company or a representative will be at fault. If there’s already a company strategy in place for responding to mistakes, every customer service representative should be made aware of it during training. If there’s no specific company-wide plan, touch upon best methods for issuing an apology to a customer with sincerity and a clear explanation of all actions being taken to correct the problem.

**5. When to Refer an Issue to a Manager**
An ambitious, eager-to-please new hire might be at risk of trying to take on too much without asking for help. Make sure to cover all department policies related to what actions need to be approved by a manager before implementation and which cases should be handed over to a superior entirely for best results.

Starting a new job is simultaneously exciting and overwhelming. Encourage new customer service representatives to ask many questions, and be patient with them if some information needs to be reviewed more than once. Offering a bonus to expert employees who help with training/shadowing can provide an incentive to stay positive and encouraging to the new hire. Be encouraging throughout the process to help ease the stress of training. The first few weeks of a job will set the tone of the relationship a new representative will have with the company moving forward, strive to make it a positive one.
