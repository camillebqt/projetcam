The business landscape is overrun with products promising solutions for a better-run business. A good sales pitch or impressive idea might tempt a company to purchase a product that fails to satisfy their needs. A help desk is supposed to bring greater organization to business operations, improve communication with customers and within the department, and aid in collecting feedback and rewarding good work. Once a business has identified their needs, the first step is taken care of; the next step is figuring out which help desk best fits those needs.





Chances are, any business dependent on internet, e-mail and other computer-based tools, has a technical support department that is swamped. Every time the company decides to implement new software or purchase a new program, those in nearby departments are likely to hear audible groans from the IT staff. Opting for a cloud based help desk is likely to solicit gratitude from the IT department. Cloud based products save IT time, take up zero additional space on the company server and don’t require internal backup.

The more complicated a help desk is, the more likely the company is to devote excessive time and energy to teaching employees to use it—possibly to little effect.  People are more likely to embrace something they can understand in [less than 15 minutes](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/take-a-tour.php). Sometimes features that look exciting during the sales process are largely unnecessary in practice. Don’t just go for the help desk with the most bells and whistles, keep in mind ease of use and focus on identifying the features most  useful to the customer service staff.

A business looking to reduce repetitive tasks like [assigning](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2012/01/tip-of-week-auto-assigning-tickets.html) every customer inquiry to a representative should look for a help desk that automates those practices. If employees use different types of computers, it's important to find one that works on multiple platforms. Want to set up a system to encourage and track progress? Find a help desk that lets users [rate their customer service experience](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2012/01/tip-of-week-www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog-number.html) and [tracks how long it takes](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2011/11/tip-of-week-tracking-time-spent-on.html) to resolve an inquiry. For a business that values corporate branding on everything it does, be sure to find one that allows for customization. These are just a few ways help desk [features](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/features.php) can aid a business. Think about your company’s needs and preferences and how a help desk can be applied to them before looking for the best solution.

Many companies will want a product that allows them to organize and view data in reports or programs they already utilize. Pay attention to what formats a help desk supports for reporting. If a company prefers its own proprietary methods and software, a help desk that supports a Developer API can help with ensuring greater integration.
