Organize and save time by viewing the user's profile directly from the ticket. Manager's and Admins can document the user's profile and company information in Mojo and have it viewable on tickets managed by techs. Techs can view the user's contact information, notes and company information easily by clicking on "profile" next to the user's name. The tech can also update the user's notes with each ticket submitted. ![](file:///C:/Users/jill/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-6.png)
