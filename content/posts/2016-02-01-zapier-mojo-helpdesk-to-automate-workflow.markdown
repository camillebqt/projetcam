It is a big day for Zapier as they just launched a new feature to create process workflows: Multi-Step Zaps. Now you can chain as many Actions as you want to a single Trigger, which makes the Mojo Helpdesk integration with other business apps on Zapier much more powerful.

For example, say you want to create a user in Mojo Helpdesk when a contact in Office 365 has been created and you also want to create a contact in Salesforce, Multi-Step Zaps allow you to do this.

A Multi-Step Zap could also allow you to create a Mojo Helpdesk service ticket from a Google Calendar Event and create a card for the Service Board in Trello. The only thing you would need to do is create the Google Calendar Event and the Zap does the rest.

The best part about the Multi-Step Zaps is you are not limited to two or three steps, they can expand to four steps, 14 steps, or even more.

If you have questions about using Zapier with Mojo Helpdesk or need help creating a Zap, don't hesitate to reach out.
