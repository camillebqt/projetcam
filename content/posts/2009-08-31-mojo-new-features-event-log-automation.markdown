We rolled out 2  new features for Mojo Helpdesk: Event Log and Automation.  
  
Event log: Mojo now tracks all help desk events and user actions. Since some businesses require long retention periods, Enterprise Plus plan customers can retain their logs for up to two year versus one day for the free plan.  
  
Automation: It is obviously about automating repetitive tasks like automatically assigning a ticket based on its category, or based on certain keywords it contains. For example all tickets in the category 'Repair' could be automatically assigned to Bill while tickets in the 'Refund request' category will go to Isabelle.  
  
Automation actions are not limited to assignments. Other actions are available as well: email someone, change ticket priority, re-assign, add a message, etc...  
  
A typical usage of automations is to create escalation paths to manage ticket service levels, such as late or about to be late tickets. All plans have this feature enabled and the more powerful plans have a bigger number of automations than the smaller ones.
