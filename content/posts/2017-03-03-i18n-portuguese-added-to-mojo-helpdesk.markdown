We are happy to announce the release of Portuguese as a language option in Mojo Helpdesk.  We have been working hard on the internationalization of Mojo Helpdesk - with more languages to come. If you would like a specific language added, please let us know.

You can configure the Portuguese language for your helpdesk interface by going to Admin Settings -> Helpdesk Configuration. Here you will set the language for the account. Individual users can choose to change the language in their interface by going to their user profile and selecting the language there.
