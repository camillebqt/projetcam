Take your helpdesk to the most responsive level by adding SnapEngage Chat to your Mojo Help Center.

By integrating SnapEngage with Mojo Helpdesk you can chat directly with customers that visit the help center, create tickets from chat transcripts and create tickets out of offline messages.

Agents can keep track of each chat engagement and history in Mojo Helpdesk.

**Chat Messages are sent to a Mojo Queue**

When chat conversations are closed, the chat transcript or offline message is automatically sent to the helpdesk as a ticket. Just add the Mojo queue email address as the chat message recipient.
