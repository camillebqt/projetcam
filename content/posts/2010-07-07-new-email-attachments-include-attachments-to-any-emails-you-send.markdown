We are happy to announce that your Helpdesk agents can now send emails to customers with any attachment they desire in Mojo Helpdesk. Simply create a new ticket (or work with an existing one), click “attach files” and then “Choose File.” You now have the option to “add to email.”

**_Why is this important to you?_**




Your customers now have the option to view ticket attachments either in the portal or their email.
