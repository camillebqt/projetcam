Mojo Helpdesk is excited to announce our new Google Apps User Sync integration. With user sync you can import all your Google Apps users into Mojo Helpdesk in a few mouse clicks. For example:








 	
  * Businesses that have large classes of new hires starting every summer can now import them all seamlessly from Google Apps.

 	
  * School or universities with hundreds of new students enrolling each fall can now add them to Mojo with no manual data entry.

 	
  * Government agencies now have the ability to quickly add temp workers and seasonal employees as Mojo users.










If you've already integrated Mojo Helpdesk with Google Apps, all you have to do is click the 'Google Apps Users Synchronization' in the Admin menu and you'll be given the option to import all your Google Apps users (see below).

If you haven't integrated Mojo Helpdesk with Google Apps, you'll need to do so in order to take advantage of the user sync feature. As a first step, watch this [short video on how to integrate with Google Apps](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/google-apps.php). As a final step in the integration process, check the box for 'Import Google users' as shown below and you'll be all set.

Here are a few additional things you should know about the Google User Sync integration:



 	
  1. All of your Google Apps users are imported as 'users' in Mojo Helpdesk, so if any help desk staff are imported you'll need to change their 'Role' status from 'user' to 'technician.'

 	
  2. During the synchronization, existing Mojo users will _not_ be duplicated but Mojo will update their user profile to be consistent with Google Apps.

 	
  3. Users whom you've suspended in Google Apps will be imported to Mojo Helpdesk as inactive users.
