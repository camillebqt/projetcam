Mojo Helpdesk customers have expressed the need to have agents access tickets in certain queues only. We are happy to announce that this is now possible using a new user role called Restricted Technician.

For Enterprise and Enterprise Plus accounts, this role can be selected when creating or editing an agent record. Restricted Technicians are only allowed to access tickets in their specified queues. They donâ€™t have access to anything else.

This new agent role is perfect for organizations that need to set up multiple departments under one helpdesk, to assign tickets to outside vendors, or to keep some requests strictly confidential.
