The following new enhancements were implemented based on feedback from our customers:



	
  * To find unassigned tickets more easily we renamed the navigation link, "Pick Box" to "Unassigned" to make it obvious to new users.â€‹



	
  * The reports are now displayed in the left navigation menu for easier access.

  * And finally, the Dashboard, SLA and Leaderboard reports are now exportable to a CSV format. These CSV files can be conveniently sent to a client or supervisor or could be used to build out proprietary Excel reports (please note that the exportable reports feature is only available on the new helpdesk plans).
