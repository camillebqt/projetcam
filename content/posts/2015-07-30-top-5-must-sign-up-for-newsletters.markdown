For some people, newsletters are just like spam, these undesired emails that pop-up in our inbox at the most inopportune time. But for us, newsletters can also be incredibly interesting, useful, and sometimes very funny. That's why we decided to share with you our favorite newsletters.

## **[Damn I Wish I Thought of It](http://damniwish.com/)**




#### **The "Incredibly Entertaining" Newsletter**


Andy Sernovitz claims that his “Damn, I wish I’d thought of that” newsletter is full of unusually useful ideas for smart marketers. This is beyond true. What he doesn't mention is that his newsletter is not only interesting, but Andy is able to add a whole lot of fun to serious tips and ideas. Let's use an example from one of his recent articles titled [The Lessons from Pets Issue](http://damniwish.com/newsletter-1047-the-lessons-from-pets-issue/) in which he talks about things you can learn from your furry friends and turns them into opportunities to connect with your customers and create an awesomely positive experience.

## **[Lifehack](http://​lifehack.org) **




#### **The "All Your Questions Answered (and More!)" Newsletter**


If you need tips and tricks for your social, personal and work life, Lifehack is perfect for you. In addition to having articles about the [30 things kids born in the 2000s would never understand](http://www.lifehack.org/291086/30-things-kids-born-the-2000s-would-never-understand), this newsletter also offers some really good and to the point advice (may we recommend [15 signs you are ready to start your own business](http://www.lifehack.org/285029/15-signs-you-are-ready-start-your-own-business)). With so many topics covered, this may be the last stop you make to have all your questions answered.

## **[PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/)**




#### **The "Everything You Need to Know" Newsletter**


Can't get enough information about all things technology, while look no further, we highly recommend signing up to receive PC Magazine's newsletter. This newsletter specializes in product reviews, tech news, buying guide, and anything else you want to know about the latest and greatest information out there. If you're following the new Microsoft update, recently PC Magazine published a very interesting article that shares the top [10 Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 10](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2487499,00.asp) and why you can finally exhale a sigh of relief. Just another great article that proves this newsletter is at the edge of information we want (nay, need) to know about.

## **[Internet Scout](https://scout.wisc.edu)**




#### **The "Research Done for You" Newsletter**


In a nutshell, let the geniuses do the work for you. At Internet Scout, the Scout research team creates or finds software solutions for just about anyone who wants to learn (although they say it's for educators, librarians, and researchers) and deliver it through their newsletters.  They recently shared some great links about [teaching history with 100 objects](http://www.teachinghistory100.org/) which is a very interesting website about the British Museum and the [Climate Change](http://climate.nasa.gov/) website made by the Nasa, which easily explains global warming.

## **[Zapier](http://zapier.com)**




#### **The "Honorary" Newsletter**


Ok, so maybe Zapier only sends out newsletters for information about their app, but that can't stop us from sharing their amazing blog and making them an honorary newsletter. In short, if you want to be more productive, Zapier helps you to improve productivity. Zapier is principally a developer platform that allow you to connect your own apps with each other, but it also has a great blog (which is very similar to a newsletter! I know, we don't play by the rules, but it's because we love their articles). Most of the time they recommend extremely useful applications for improved performance, like this [Best Time Tracking Apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-time-tracking-apps/) post.
