Previously you were only able to change ticket status or add a comment in bulk, but with the latest release of Mojo Helpdesk you can now change the ticket priority and queue from the bulk actions menu. This means much more power to edit tickets straight from the ticket list.

For example,  if you are in the _Unassigned_ ticket list you can select a group of tickets and change them all to a specific queue before assigning them.  Or if you receive several tickets regarding the same critical issue you could select them all at once and change them to 'Emergency' at the same time.

Thanks to all of you for your feature requests and suggestions. Your important feedback allows us to continue making improvements to Mojo Helpdesk as we strive to make it the most straight-forward yet powerful ticket tracking helpdesk in the market.
