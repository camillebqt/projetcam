Did you know that it is possible to send someone a text message from an email? Basically, every cell phone number can be sent an email that will be converted to a text if you know the correct email address to send it to. If this is news to you, check out [this list of email addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways) that can be used to send text messages to phones. Just replace "number" with the 10 digit phone number you want to text.




Using this information, it is possible to create an automation that will send a text message when a new ticket is created or when a ticket is assigned to someone. Go to the Automations link from the manage menu at the top of the page and click the new button to create a new automation. Give your automation a title and description, then set the filters. If you want a text every time a new ticket is created, click the button next to selected statuses and choose new for the status. If you would rather, you can apply this to newly assigned tickets by choosing assigned from the selected statuses menu.

Go to the actions section and click the box next to Send an email. Enter the email address for the cell number you want to receive the text in the To blank of the email form. Enter a subject and text for the body of the email, but make sure you keep it as short as possible since most text messages are limited to no more than 160 characters.  Click create and activate and you are ready to start receiving text notifications of new or newly assigned tickets.
