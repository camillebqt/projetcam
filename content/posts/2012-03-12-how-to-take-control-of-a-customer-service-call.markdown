Every so often, the role of a customer service representative can veer uncomfortably towards that of a therapist. For some people, when upset, the knowledge of someone on the other end of a phone line that’s willing to listen is enough to provoke a prolonged lament about general problems. When a representative finds him or herself on the receiving end of such a call, its important to find a tactful way to take control of the call to quickly resolve the situation and move on to other responsibilities. While it’s important to be sensitive to the needs of the customer, it’s equally important not to allow one customer to monopolize your time at the expense of other customers and general productivity.

Taking control of a customer service call while remaining polite is one of the trickier skills a good customer service representative should have in his or her arsenal. It requires finding the right balance between honoring time management concerns and making sure an upset, overly talkative customer feels taken care of. Keep these few tips in mind to help navigate difficult situations.


## **Start the Service Call Right**


Make sure the customer’s problem and desired solution are stated as early in the call as possible. If a customer has a hard time explaining the problem or desired solution in specific terms, ask pointed questions to help clarify.

**Take Every Opportunity to Keep the Conversation Focused on Finding and ****Implementing a Solution**

Certain personality types just have a hard time staying on topic. When a customer continually shifts a phone conversation to topics unrelated to reaching the desired solution, treat every response as an opportunity to nudge the conversation back in the right direction. Consider lines like: ““I’m sorry to hear that. So, in order to fix this what we need to do today is…” as a lead in to suggesting a specific action item.

**Make Sure To Keep Your End of the Conversation Brief and On Point**

Set an example. Don’t let yourself get off topic or you’re setting a tone for the conversation that implies it doesn’t need to be all business. It’s the job of the customer service representative to help the customer solve a specific problem related to the product or service, not to become his or her close confidante.

**Once the Problem, Solution, and Needed Actions are Determined, Wrap Up the Service Call**

Use language that lets the customer know it’s time for the call to come to an end.
Some suggested lines to consider:



 	
  * “Sounds like we’ve covered everything…”

 	
  * “I’ll get started on this right away…”

 	
  * "I don't want to take up anymore of your time, so..."

 	
  * "I have everything I need on my end..."




## **With Overly Persistent Customers, Put Them On Hold to Work Out Strategy**


If all the other tips have been unsuccessful, as a last resort, put the caller on hold. This provides a few moments to organize thoughts and figure out the best way to approach wrapping up the call effectively. It also provides a second opportunity to re-establish the tone of the call and assert greater control over the situation.

Time is valuable. As a customer service representative, it’s useful to approach most situations with an accommodating demeanor, but it’s just as important to have the capability to shift into a more take control attitude from time to time, steer the conversation in the right direction, and take control of the conversation to resolve issues efficiently.
