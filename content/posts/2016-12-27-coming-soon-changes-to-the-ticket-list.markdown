We will soon release some important changes to the ticket layout view. These improvements are being made in order to create a more user friendly experience on smaller devices as well as to create a more responsive site.

The first change you will notice is the ticket search and search filters has moved from the list to the navigation bar.  Moving the search bar is important because now search is available from every page without having to click the + ticket search button.

Secondly, we improved the ticket compact layout by resizing the columns and minimizing the ticket description. The ticket description is now visible when hovering over the ticket title.  The detailed view has also been improved by reformatting the ticket data.

Our plan is to release the new layout in the next week or so. In the meantime we look forward to hearing any feedback about the new changes.
