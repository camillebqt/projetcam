We have listened to our customers regarding our recent update of the attachment interface, and we are quickly moving to change it back to what it was previously.







When you are working with an existing ticket, you currently find the attachment icon (with the list of attachments) at the top of the page (beside the “event log” link). Per your request, we will restore the list of attachments back to the bottom of the page. Please stay tuned for our next update regarding this change.
