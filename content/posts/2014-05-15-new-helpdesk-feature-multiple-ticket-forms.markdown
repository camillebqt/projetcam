Mojo Helpdesk is excited to announce our newest release: Multiple Ticket Forms. You now have the option to create a unique ticket form for each request type that you support.
For example an IT department might support several issues. Now the department can have a form for each case such as a ‘New Employee Set Up’, ‘Employee Termination’, ‘Purchase Request’, and ‘Technical Support’.

A school district would be able to create a different form for each of the schools it represents and an accounting department could set it up to handle specific requests for accounts payable and accounts receivable.  You could also create internal and external request forms.

To create ticket forms in your helpdesk go to Manage > All Settings > Ticket Forms.

Here you will see the basic form that is being used to create tickets. You can add a new form by clicking the ‘add new form’ button on the right hand side of the page. Now you can give your form a title and add some help text if necessary. Then you can choose a queue in which your new form will create tickets. If you would like to let the user choose their queue there is an option for this as well. Next, you will choose who can view this form, all users or helpdesk staff only.



Once the form is created, then the form's fields can be customized.

When you have finished adding and re-ordering fields you can publish your new form to make it available.
