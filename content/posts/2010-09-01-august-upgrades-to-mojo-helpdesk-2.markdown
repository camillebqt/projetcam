August was a very busy month at Mojo Helpdesk. We completed upgrades to our infrastructure (see previous [blog](http://bit.ly/9sKAaK)) and updated the UI (user interface). The infrastructure work provided for a more scalable application and the changes to the navigation buttons made Mojo Helpdesk even easier to use.

We are not slowing down in September, as we will continue to enhance the service. Stay tuned for a number of announcements very soon.
