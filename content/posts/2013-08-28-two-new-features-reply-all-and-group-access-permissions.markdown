We're happy to announce two new features have been added to Mojo today - **reply all** and **group access permissions**.<!-- more -->


### Reply All




Available when recipients have already been CC'd on a ticket, you can click the **'reply all'** link to instantly add those same recipients back in the CC field so they get notified when you add a comment.

###  Group Access Permissions







Available from the **'manage'** >> **users view, **you can now add a user to a **'Group'** and then determine whether you want to give them **'Full'** group access with permission to open, close, comment and rate tickets for that group or **'Comment only' **access** **where users may only comment on tickets opened by others in the group.







As a reminder, the **'Group Access'** feature is intended to give group managers a view of all tickets created by users in their group.
