Mojo Helpdesk has two updates to announce:

**#1 Email templates can now be configured to automatically include the Start Date and Due Date** for a ticket using our new due date variable {{ticket.due_on}} and scheduled date variable {{ticket.scheduled_on}}.<!-- more -->



[![56 2 Due Date Blog - Email Template](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/56-2-Due-Date-Blog-Email-Template.png)](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/56-2-Due-Date-Blog-Email-Template.png)

**#2 Staff member messages and email comments will be visible to the ticket submitter on all tickets**. The previous default setting made staff member messages from email private on all unassigned tickets.  Private comments can still be added anytime (as shown in the screenshot below).

If you have any questions about these updates, please send an email to mojohelpdesk.com@support.metadot.com.
