We have been quietly rolling out a new feature: **the form widget**. It allows adding a ticket form inside any website by just adding a small HTML snippet of code.
As shown in the picture below, the widget creates a tab that, when clicked, opens a ticket form.  When the form is submitted, it creates a ticket in your Mojo Helpdesk.

The form's tab is customizable so you can choose a color that matches your website. You could also add multiple forms and change the text to relate to a necessary topic. For example, one form can be for general questions and another for technical support.

The form widget is available for all Mojo Helpdesk plans.
