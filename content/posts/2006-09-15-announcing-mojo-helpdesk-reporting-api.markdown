We are pleased to release the first version of [Mojo Helpdesk API](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog-help.metadot.com/). It is implemented with web services and SOAP. The API allows programmers to access the ticket information and create custom reports.  
  
The API is available to all Mojo Helpdesk customers, from the free plan to the Enterprise one. Thank to all for their feedback and suggestions.
