## A Detail That Makes All the Difference:


Once you have done the work and a ticket is ready to be closed, do you feel a sense of accomplishment? Of course. Does clicking on the "Close" button for a ticket satisfy this feeling? Hardly so!

Your Mojo team wanted to do better: When closing a ticket, a giant "CLOSED" word graphic falls from above, like a giant real-time stamp on paper.

Check it out, do you feel a sense of accomplishment just by looking at this?

Be careful, resist the urge to close, reopen, close, reopen a ticket again and again (as some of our employees have been doing so) just for the fun of it. :)
