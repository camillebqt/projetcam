Because we know that productivity is one of the most important components of a successful company, our Mojo Helpdesk team wanted to bring you the Top 5 Must Have Apps that are incredibly easy to use and will increase productivity.


## **Project Management: [Trello](https://trello.com/)**


Work is much easier when you're organized. You won't have to waste time searching through piles of paper to find what you need or fruitlessly hunt down that one email that you know has the requirements for the next project. Well, look no further, Trello is the perfect tool for people who want to become more productive by increasing organization. This online tool will help you to manage projects and personal tasks, giving you the gift of organization and putting your to-do-list right at your fingertips.




## **Video Producing & Editing: [Camtasia Studio](http://discover.techsmith.com/try-camtasia/?gclid=COCkn5mdg8cCFZGJaQodsHYKnA)**


For any company that needs to create video tutorials on their products, Camtasia is the perfect application (and we don't use perfect often). Camtasia allows you to record your computer screen, edit videos, and share them on your website. The software itself is incredibly user friendly, so much so, that you won't need to read instructions to operate it. Similar to a modern camera, Camtasia is a professional tool with easy to understand mechanics so that anyone can use it. Simply sign up for the software and go. It's that simple.

## **Email Marketing: [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/?pid=GAW&source=website&gclid=CNLUwqOdg8cCFQataQoduuUMxQ)**


Want to create awesome looking emails with little to no effort? MailChimp is your tool. This app records every newsletter sign-up and allows you to create and send emails to subscribers. You can easily drag and drop items into the emails including social icons, images, call-to-action buttons and text...all at the click of a button. There are also a wide variety of ready to use templates if you don't want to create your own. Select the template you like, change the colors to match your brand, and you're ready to send. We love this website because not only does it make email creation simple, it's also really fun.




## **CRM: [Insightly](https://www.insightly.com/)**


With Insightly, you can manage leads, contacts, vendors, suppliers, projects, and more! Yes, yes...you can do that with a lot of CRM tools, but what makes Insightly so great, is that it's affordable and easy to use. With Insightly, you can see the background of a project, email history, important dates, all the details about a customer or vendor, and pick up right where you left off. We highly recommend Insightly for sales teams to get organized, have all the critical information on hand, and ensure customers get what they need in a timely manner.






## **Helpdesk / Ticket Tracking: [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/)**
