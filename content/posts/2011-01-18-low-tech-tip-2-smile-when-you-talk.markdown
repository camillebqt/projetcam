 It's not only low-tech and low cost, it is also totally free to be friendly.


I'm sure many businesses would agree their customer service team is customer-friendly, but just because the support agents have been trained to ask things like, 'how are you today' and 'did I solve your problem', does not necessarily mean they are friendly: it's all about the tone of voice.

The tone of voice warms up when someone smiles and shows genuine friendliness. So tell your service agents to smile when they talk, it will instantly light up the tone of their voice and make them sound friendly.  And because most customer service interactions happen over the phone, agents don't even need to be pretty: a good warm and energetic smiling voice will do the job. That's all it takes.
