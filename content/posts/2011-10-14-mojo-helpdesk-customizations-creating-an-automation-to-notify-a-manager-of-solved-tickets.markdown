Automations are a Mojo Helpdesk feature that can save time and effort by automatically executing a set of actions on a set of targeted tickets. It is possible to create automations that change a ticketâ€™s priority, assign or re-assign tickets, add a comment to a ticket, or send an email. Filters can be created to set the automation to run only if the ticket meets specific criteria like the status of the ticket, the company who created the ticket, and the priority level.  
  


The time it takes to plan an automation is small compared to how much you'll save on administrative tasks. Check out the video below to learn how to create an automation that sends an email when a ticket is marked solved.
