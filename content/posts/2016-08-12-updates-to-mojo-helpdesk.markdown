Mobile Update: Based on customer feedback, we released an update to the mobile apps which includes the addition of displaying the queue in the ticket list view.  Now it is easy to see which queue the ticket is in from any ticket list without needing to filter by queue.

Desktop Update: In the 'compact'  ticket list view we added two new column options to bring into your ticket list, _Ticket ID_ and _Time to Solve_. The ticket ID will now appear in the ticket list for those that reference tickets by the ticket number. The Time to Solve column will display the time it took to solve the ticket, perfect to use when viewing solved and closed ticket lists.

Please keep providing feedback so we can continue our efforts to make Mojo the best ticket tracking/helpdesk software available.
