Mojo Helpdesk is introducing a new way to categorize and track tickets: ticket tags.  Similar to project board tags or email labels, Mojo Helpdesk now supports color-coded ticket tags. Tags can be added to any ticket easily, are completely customizable and self-defined.

For example, tags can be set up to flag tickets with a secondary status 'needs follow up' or 'pending approval'.  Tags can also be used to set alternative priorities such as 'high-level' or 'low-level'.  Best of all triggers can be set up to take action on tagged tickets or to set tags automatically on certain types of tickets.

Once tickets are tagged, agents can search tickets by tags using the search filters.

Also, Managers and Admins can use the Dashboard report to filter by tags to see how many of those tickets were open or closed within a reporting period.
