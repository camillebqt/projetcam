  * Revamp of ticket listings  

  * Reassigning a ticket can now be done in the ticket view  

  * The search is now available on every page  

  
A new customer portal  
  
The helpdesk landing page is now The Customer Portal that includes a customizable home page. Go to manage> Configure Mojo Helpdesk to change it.  
  
  
Improved branding customization  
  
Mojo Helpdesk now also all plans to customize logos and helpdesk pages.  
  
  
Guest request revamp  


  * Unregistered users can create new tickets w/o you having to create accounts. We removed the 'request and account' feature since user accounts are created automatically when an unregistered user create a request.
  * Custom ticket fields are now present in the guest request
  
We also fixed few annoying bugs.  
  
As we develop most features based on customer input please don't hesitate to contact us with your suggestions.
