Finally we succumbed to the blog virus. Blog is mode? Certainly. But we also see that as a great way to keep our user base in touch with us.

So, for our first blog article I am going to publish the company resolutions along with mine.

Publishing them online put some pressure on us to make them happen. Once we brag about things it is difficult just to retract them. So here we go:

  1. stay hungry, stay foolish (adopted from Steve Jobsâ€™ advise to Stanford graduates
  2. start a company blog :)
  3. release great and useful online tools and services
  4. micro manage pixels: make the above services enjoyable to use
  5. try to become an important player in online services
  6. stop using the laptop at night in the bed
