Based on customer feedback, we have updated the customer satisfaction ratings in the user portal to match the ratings by email.  The new rating mechanism in the user interface allows the customer to choose between 1 and 5 stars when they close their ticket.

This improvement will help agents receive ratings that are more appropriate to the work performed.  For example, a rating of 3 stars is not a desirable achievement. Previously a 3 star rating's correlating remark was 'works for me' -which reflects more of a positive emotion, like that of a 4 or 5 star rating. Now however, a 3 star rating is indicative of a neutral feeling, being neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, which describes the result more appropriately.

Hopefully with this improvement agents will receive more accurate ratings rather than positive remarks, but with only 3 stars.
