Long gone are the days of searching by article ID or scrolling through a list of 50 articles just to find the one you need to edit.  Mojo Helpdesk now supports search capability for managing and editing Knowledge Base articles. Eureka!

Searching articles in the helpdesk side works the same as searching for articles in the Help Center. Simply type in a keyword from the article and the search results will display the articles that relate. You can also use [boolean operators](https://help.mojohelpdesk.com/help/article/115880)  or wildcard (*) in the search to narrow down the search results.
