We have been collecting the feedback from our first distribution of Metadot 7 based on Ruby on Rails. So far so good: we have found no major issues, just tweaks to be done in the installation scripts. For those who want to get their hands on Metadot 7, go to [www.metadot.com](http://www.metadot.com/) and sign up to the Metadot Rails forum.
