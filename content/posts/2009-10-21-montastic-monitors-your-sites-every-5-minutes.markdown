We have been working on our Montastic Website Monitoring application for a while now. We rewrote a lot of the backend to allow faster monitoring intervals and to prepare for future new functionality.Â  As a result, Montastic has now paying plans with advanced capabilities.

It allows now to check your sites from once a day down to every 5 minutes. If your site is down, you get alerted by email.

Credit card payments are managed by Google Checkout which was easy to implement with Ruby On Rails. It makes the payment process very painless, reliable and secure.

We also added the ability turn monitoring off on a individual server basis. Here is the new color coding as depicted above:



	
  * Green => server is OK

	
  * Red => server is unreachable

	
  * Blue => monitoring is disabled








Check it out at [www.montastic.com](http://www.montastic.com/). You can use the free plan to monitor few servers.
