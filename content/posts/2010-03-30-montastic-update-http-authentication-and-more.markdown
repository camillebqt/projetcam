We implemented few tweaks to improve reliability of our web site monitoring service and also added one new feature: HTTP Authentication. Montastic users can now monitor their protected pages by embedding credentials in the monitoring URL as shown here:





	
  * http://username:password@mysite.com/protected_page/


This also works with HTTPS and port numbers. Here is another example:






	
  * https://username:password@mysite.com:8080/protected_page/




One feature that was also requested is to show the pricing from the front page and not bury it in a deep place inside the application: It's done, it is now accessible from the front page.
