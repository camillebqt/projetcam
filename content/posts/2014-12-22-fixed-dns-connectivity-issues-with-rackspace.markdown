Our engineers have fully resolved the impact to our DNS infrastructure. After blocking the majority of the inbound DDoS attack earlier in the morning some DNS servers that were sending both legitimate and DDoS traffic to Rackspace were blacklisted. Further investigation and alteration of our mitigation profiles resolved the last remaining issues at 12:15CST. If you continue to experience adverse impact, please reach out to your support teams and provide trace route information for further investigations. Additional details regarding this incident will be made available upon the completion of our Root Cause Analysis.


### DNS Connectivity Issues with Rackspace


We use Rackspace managed cloud services for hosting Mojo Helpdesk and today Rackspace announced an incident that might affect accessibility to some Mojo Helpdesk accounts. Not all helpdesk accounts are affected, but please be advised of Rackspace's current system status:


<blockquote>"We are monitoring a connectivity issue impacting our DNS environment that began at approximately 01:10 CST December 22nd. Our engineers have taken steps to mitigate impact from this issue, however some of our customers may continue to experience intermittent periods of latency, packet loss, or connectivity failures when attempting to reach rackspace.com or subdomains within rackspace.com. This may also continue to impact customer DNS resolution during this time. Our engineers are engaged and continuing work to stabilize the environment."</blockquote>


Thank you for your continued patience as we work to resolve this issue. If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact a member of your support team.
