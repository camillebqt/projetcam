You probably have noticed in your _My Assignments_ tab a small link titled _**Give Me More Power**_. Well, this link allows you to perform bulk operations i.e. you can apply an action to several tickets at one time.

For example, if you had 42 tickets that came in assigned to you all regarding the same issue, you could select all of them and simultaneously change the status from _assigned_ to _in progress_. Then, when you have solved this issue (because it was the same for all 42 tickets) you could change the status to _solved_ and reply with one message that will comment back to all 42 ticket submitters.

Will you be out of the office or going on vacation? You can also re-assign tickets to your lucky colleague, in bulk.
