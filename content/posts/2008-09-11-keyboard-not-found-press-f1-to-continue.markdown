The other day we got a message from a Das Keyboard customer saying that his PC did not recognize the keyboard. The error message was 

  * "Keyboard not found, press F1 to continue"   


Seriously, who is in charge of writing this stuff? Is this an official body governing the BIOS specifications? Can any one ping them about this?
