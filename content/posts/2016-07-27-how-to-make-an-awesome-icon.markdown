The Mojo Team is inspired by the best. And if Leonard Da Vinci said _"Details make perfection, and perfection is not a detail"_, we believe him. This is why we designed our new IOS icons just like the best inventor in history that drew the Vitruvian man.

We used grids and geometric lines to have the perfect icon. Details make perfection and in a 57 x 57 pixels icon, one pixel is not a detail.
