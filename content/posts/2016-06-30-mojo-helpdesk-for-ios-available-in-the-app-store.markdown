The Mojo Helpdesk iOS app is now available in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mojo-helpdesk/id1118071172?ls=1&mt=8). This is first-release beta software and we are requesting that users provide any problems or issues they find to us immediately. We hope to work out any bugs quickly to ensure an awesome mobile app experience for iOS devices.

You must have a current Mojo Helpdesk account before you download the app. Then you will need to type in your helpdesk URL and follow the prompts to login.

With the mobile app agents, managers and admins will be able to view, manage and update tickets, create new tickets, and view dashboard metrics. The purpose of the app is to give agents on the go a quick and easy way to update and resolve tickets.

Thank you in advance for your direct feedback and helping us make the Mojo Helpdesk iOS app a success.
