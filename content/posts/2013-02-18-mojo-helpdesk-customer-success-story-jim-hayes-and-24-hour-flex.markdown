In the summer of 2011, Jim signed up for Mojo Helpdesk to help his organization track customer requests. Little did he know that, about a year and a half later, we would be sending a photographer to his office in Greenwood Village, Colorado (just south of Denver)...and our photographer wasn't just packing a camera. He came with signs, lots of goofy, press board signs.





Luckily, Jim was a good sport and held up our signs while flashing his best smile. He was also kind enough to answer some questions about his experience with Mojo Helpdesk.

### Jim, please tell our readers more about 24 Hour Flex.





We provide employee benefits (FSA, HRA, HSA and COBRA administration) to clients across the United States. Our goal is to make your day better by doing our jobs really well and hopefully making you smile or laugh from time to time. We want to free up Human Resource teams and employees time by running your benefits plans well.







### What sort of challenges was 24 Hour Flex facing?





We needed a way to track issues that could not be resolved immediately in order to provide the best customer service possible to our clients.







### Which Mojo Helpdesk solution did you choose?







We chose the Enterprise solution because it gave us all of the features we needed. We use Mojo to track outstanding issues and give visibility to problems across the organization that we used to lose because only one or two people knew about the problem. Mojo also provides a great way to see issues that have not been resolved and bring more firepower to the table to solve them.







### Describe the results you experienced with Mojo Heldpesk?







We are much more proactive in solving client problems and issues, and they don't get lost in people's email.







### What is your favorite thing about Mojo Helpdesk?







Direct integration with Google Apps. Not having another login to deal with for users is huge. The ease of setup and simplicity of the design are also awesome.
