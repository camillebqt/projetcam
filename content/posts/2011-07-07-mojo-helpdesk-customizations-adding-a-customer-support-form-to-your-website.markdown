We know many of you are looking for ways to customize Mojo Helpdesk. Whether you want to brand the home page of your customer portal, create customized email templates, or set up some automations to make things run more smoothly, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be posting tutorials and even some videos on the blog to show you how to make Mojo Helpdesk your own. If you have any topic suggestions, please feel free to post them in the comments section.  
  
To start things off, we thought we’d show you how to add a Customer Support Form to your website quickly and easily with Mojo Helpdesk. There are several areas you can customize from the color of the help tab, to the title and description of the form. Best of all, once placed on your site, the form will automatically generate a ticket when someone submits the form and put it into the queue you specify. It’s a fairly simple process, just make certain you have access to your website code as you’ll need to edit the web page where you want to add the form. Watch the video below to learn more about how to add this feature to your site.
