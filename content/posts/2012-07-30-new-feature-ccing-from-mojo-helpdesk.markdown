We are happy to announce we recently upgraded Mojo Helpdesk's functionality. We wanted Mojo messaging to behave more like email, so when agents add a message or private message they are able to CC co-workers, supervisors or any others who need to stay in the loop. This means messages can be transferred to outside sources without having to register those users as staff in the helpdesk. Mojo will keep track of all communication on the ticket.
[![Cc'ing Mojo](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ccing-Mojo.png)](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ccing-Mojo.png)

Mojo Helpdesk handles responses on the ticket intuitively by marking outside messages as 'private' by default (that is, any message sent from someone other than the assignee or submitter). Alternatively, when the ticket submitter needs to be in on the communication, text can simply be copied to a non-private message by the agent.

Mojo Helpdesk is enthusiastic about our new communication feature. We hope you enjoy it, and look forward to our customer feedback.
