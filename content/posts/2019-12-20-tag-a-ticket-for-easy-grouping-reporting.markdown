Agents can quickly categorize or tag tickets as they come in to Mojo Helpdesk using ticket tags. 







Tags can be quickly created and are useful for grouping tickets and quick reporting. For example, you can use tags to track projects, mark a ticket as needing approval, or group tickets under the same root cause.
