We previously posted about the [difference between closed and solved tickets](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2011/12/tip-of-week-closed-vs-solved-tickets.html) and briefly mentioned creating an automation to help you keep your help desk clear of old, solved tickets. There is already a pre-created automation for this in the automations section of the helpdesk which can be activated at any time.  However, if you have never created an automation in Mojo Helpdesk before, this is a perfect one to start with due to its simplicity and usefulness.


Watch the video and try your hand at creating an automation for your help desk. You'll be glad you did once the automation clears out old tickets and makes it easier to keep track of open tickets that need attention.
