When companies are hit by a product quality issue they can either try to confess it publicly or to hide it. Apple tried the latter regarding its iPhone 4 poor reception problem that was confirmed by Consumer Reports. How did they do it? By [deleting message threads](http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/12/apple-deleting-mentions-of-consumer-reports-iphone-4-piece-on-f/) that mentioned the problem in its support forums. Since then Apple has acknowledged the problem and provided iPhone cases to alleviate it.
