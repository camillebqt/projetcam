In our continuous effort to improve the usability of Mojo Heldesk, here are the changes included in our latest release.








## Direct access to the Admin page:







"Helpdesk Settings" has been renamed "Admin" and a button has been added in the top navigation bar for direct access to ​the Admin page.

## How-to videos icon change:




Did you know many of the views in Mojo Helpdesk have built-in video help? The video help icon has been changed as shown in the screenshot below:

​The "Helpdesk Administration" section in the Admin page has been renamed "Account Administration." This is where the account information such as Account Billing, API Information, etc. is located.
