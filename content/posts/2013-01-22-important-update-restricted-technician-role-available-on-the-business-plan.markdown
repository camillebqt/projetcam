Business Plan subscribers now have the ability to restrict access rights for agents (also known as queue-based access rights). Previously the ability to set an agent as a restricted technician (RT) was available only on the Enterprise and Enterprise Plus plans.

**The restricted technician role can be selected when creating or editing an agent record. Restricted technicians are only allowed to access tickets in their specified queues. ********It's most useful when tickets are assigned to outside vendors, or when certain tickets need to be kept confidential, or ********when tickets for different departments are managed by one helpdesk.**
