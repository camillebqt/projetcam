Today we are extremely excited to announce the release of Mojo Helpdesk in French. This is the first phase of the internationalization of Mojo Helpdesk, with many more languages to come. This means countries around the world (and galaxies far away) will be able to open up support to their customers in their own language without having to translate or customize anything.

For the French speakers you can enable this feature now. There is a main setting that will display the Help Center portal in French as default. This can be turned on by going to Helpdesk Settings> Helpdesk Configuration. In the 'Language Settings' section, select 'French'.

This displays the Help Center in French by default but each logged in user can configure the language from their user profile. So agents that want to display the helpdesk side in French will do this from their user profile.

Here is how: Click on the drop arrow next to the profile picture at the top of the page and choose 'Profile'. Here you will see a drop down to select the language. Each agent can choose to view the helpdesk side in French or English, which ever they prefer.

Au revoir,

Mojo Helpdesk
