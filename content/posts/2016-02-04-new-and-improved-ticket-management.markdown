Mojo Helpdesk is happy to announce the latest release takes ticket management to a whole new level.

The ticket lists have been revamped displaying a customizable compact view and a streamlined detailed view. Columns can now be added to the tickets lists to display a time stamp, ticket type, form, group or queue.  All columns are able to be sorted just by clicking on the column name.  Also Mojo will remember the column customization when switching from list to list.

The detailed ticket list has been improved displaying more details. Assigning, re-assigning and changing status is able to be performed directly from the detailed list.

The bulk actions select box now allows selecting a group of tickets by status before editing. So if you want to change all tickets that are solved to closed, you can perform the action in one step from any ticket list.
