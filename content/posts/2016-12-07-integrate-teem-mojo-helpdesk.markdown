If you use [Teem](https://teem.com/) for internal meetings and managing workspaces be sure to connect it to your Mojo Helpdesk using Zapier.  When you submit technical issues as work requests in Teem they will automatically create a new ticket in Mojo populating the correct fields which is then auto-assigned to the correct technician. Much better than Teem just emailing the request to your helpdesk.




Teem is a cloud-based platform that makes it easy for your employees to meet and book conference rooms, to efficiently manage workspaces and meeting resources, and to measure and analyze your company’s meeting and collaboration behavior.
