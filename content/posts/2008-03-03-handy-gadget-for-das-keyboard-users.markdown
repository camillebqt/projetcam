The world typing speed record is 212 wpm (words per minute). A fast hunt-and-peck typist will be at 25 wpm, a slow touch-typist at 50 wpm. Most Das Keyboard users are above 50 wpm. How fast can you type? Check your speed and monitor your touch-typing daily work out with this [USB speedometer](http://www.drinkstuff.com/products/product.asp?ID=4622&title=USB+Speedometer).
