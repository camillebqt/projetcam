Do you have questions about some features of Mojo Helpdesk? Did you know that many Mojo Helpdesk views have a built-in how-to video?

![Mojo_Improve_Blog_howto-1v3](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mojo_Improve_Blog_howto-1v3.png)

Many views have a built-in video icon located at the top right corner of the view. Since it is an in-context video, clicking on the link will open a video window without leaving the current view so you can get back to work quickly.

Also if you want to learn about many Mojo Helpdesk features, there is a page that displays [all videos available](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/how-to-videos/). Whether you are a brand new ticket tracker or a veteran queue warrior, these videos can really help you get the most out of your Mojo Helpdesk experience.
