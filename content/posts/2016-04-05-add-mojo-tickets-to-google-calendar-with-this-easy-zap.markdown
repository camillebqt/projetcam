Mojo Helpdesk released new functionality in Zapier that allows you to create Google Calendar Events from Mojo Helpdesk tickets.  This works when you create a new ticket that has either a scheduled date or due date entered. Note: this does not work if you add a scheduled date/due date after a ticket has been created.

To create the Zap, login to your Zapier account. If you don't have a Zapier account you can create one for free. The free plan allows 5 Zaps.

In Zapier, search for Mojo Helpdesk as the Trigger:

Now, select the Trigger type: (new ticket with scheduled date or new ticket with due date)

![triggertype](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/triggertype.jpg)



Then select the Mojo Helpdesk account: (To connect a Mojo account, click + new account and add your API access key located in your Mojo user profile)

![select_account](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/select_account.jpg)



Next, search for Google Calendar as the Action:

![chooseaction](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/chooseaction.jpg)



Select "New Detailed Event" as the Calendar Action:

![newdetailedevent](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/newdetailedevent.jpg)



Add/Select the Google Calendar to use:

![select_calendar_account](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/select_calendar_account.jpg)



Last, set up the Google Calendar Event based on the Mojo Helpdesk ticket fields. You can use the ticket title as the Event summary/title, the ticket description as the Event description and the Event location can be another ticket field such as the Queue or the Group name:

![setupgoogleevent](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/setupgoogleevent.jpg)



Once this is done, you can turn on your Zap. When tickets are created in Mojo Helpdesk that contain a scheduled date or due date these will be automatically added to your Google Calendar. Use the Google Calendar settings to send email or pop-up alerts and invite others to the ticket event.



We hope you enjoy!
