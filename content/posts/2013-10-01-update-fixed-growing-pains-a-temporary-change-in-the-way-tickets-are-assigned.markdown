**UPDATE -** We have added the functionality back to the unassigned ticket list. You are now able to assign tickets from this list as well as assign or delete in bulk. Thank you for your patience.




### Mojo is growing.


We handle more tickets per day than ever. Sometimes our service is overloaded and we work hard to scale up our resources.





The good news is we made our application a lot faster. The performance issue is resolved. Displaying the unassigned ticket list is now blazing fast even for a help desk that has thousands of new tickets.







However, in order to do this we had to make a compromise in functionality. We had to temporarily change the way unassigned tickets are presented. In addition, at this time you will not be able to perform 'bulk actions' (like assign or delete), but this is temporary.  We are working on adding the functionality back in the next few days.







Thank you for your continuous support.
