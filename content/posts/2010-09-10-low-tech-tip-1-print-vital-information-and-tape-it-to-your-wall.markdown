It’s “go” time, and you’re on the spot to respond to a client’s question. Do you have the answer at the ready? Do you need to ask someone, search the intranet, call them back, or worse, forward them to another person?  
  
To answer questions the fastest possible way, keep answers of common questions handy on printed paper. Yes, paper: the old fashioned way. For example, print the company price list, return policies, shipping costs, current promotions, etc.  
  
While it isn’t always possible to have all the answers taped to the wall, having some FAQs prominently displayed will allow you to be the quickest responder.
