Mojo Helpdesk is excited to announce our **new support portal** and **knowledge base**. 





[![new mojo helpdesk portal](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/new-mojo-helpdesk-portal.png)](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/new-mojo-helpdesk-portal.png)


_Preview of the new Mojo Helpdesk support portal._







Our design team has given the portal a makeover and added customization options that make it easy to match the look of the portal with the look of your site.






With the searchable knowledge base you can publish articles & FAQs to the portal directly from the Mojo dashboard. Users can search the knowledge base to see if existing documentation answers their question before they submit a ticket.You can see a full size screenshot of the new support portal [here](http://postimg.org/image/sdgyeqhrl/).


### Key Features





	
  * Modern and intuitive user interface makes portal visitors happy.

	
  * Custom background & color options allow organizations to match the portal with the design of their website.

	
  * Searchable knowledge base lets agents publish FAQs directly from Mojo dashboard so that customers can self-help.

	
  * Mobile friendly design make it easy to view & submit tickets from cell phones & tablets.




###  What You Should Know





	
  * The customer portal and knowledge base release is scheduled for the week of August 5th. We are working diligently to avoid service interruption, but some intermittent slowness and downtime may occur. [Follow our Twitter page](https://twitter.com/mojohelpdesk) for updates.

	
  * All your existing portal text and ticket data will be migrated over to the new interface. No action is required.

	
  * Knowledge base is turned OFF by default for existing customers. Here is how you can turn it on and start creating articles:

	
    * Click 'manage' >> 'Support Portal'

	
    * Select 'Portal Settings'

	
    * Show Knowledge Base? >> Yes >> Save




	
  * To publish your first knowledge base article:

	
    * Step 1: Create a topic

	
      * Click 'manage' >> 'Knowledge Base'

	
      * Select 'Knowledge Base Topics'

	
      * Click '+new topic'

	
      * Input a Title >> Save




	
    * Step 2: Create an article within the topic

	
      * Select  'Articles'

	
      * Click '+new article'

	
      * Add a Title

	
      * Leave 'Publishing' status set to 'published'

	
      * Select a topic

	
      * Add keywords and article content

	
      * Click 'Save article'







	
  * 'My Company Tickets' label has changed to 'My Group Tickets'







###  Other Important Notes and FAQs





	
  * **Can I continue to use the old portal interface?** No, the new portal and knowledge base are being rolled out as permanent, global changes. Suggestions and feedback can be sent to support@support.metadot.com

	
  * **Where is my logo? **Logos will not be migrated over as part of the release. To add your company's logo to the new portal:

	
    * click manage > support portal >> Portal Settings

	
    * Add an image URL for your logo in the Portal Main Content text area or the News Column Content text area.

	
    * To insert HTML image of logo use the image HTML tag. Of note, you'll need to host your image online somewhere like [http://postimage.org/](http://postimage.org/)




	
  * **How do I change the order of the knowledge base topics and articles? **Version 1.0 of the knowledge base supports a numeric ordering system. If you want your articles to appear in order, number them 1, 2, 3, etc. Before populating the knowledge base with all of your documentation, we recommend drafting an outline of your knowledge base so that you enter your topics and article in the order you wish them to appear on the portal page.
