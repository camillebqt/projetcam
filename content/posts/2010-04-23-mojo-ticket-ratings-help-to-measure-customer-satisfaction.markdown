It is well known that measuring customer satisfaction is one of the most important things an organization can do to learn the needs of its customers and keep them.   Surveying is a popular way to gain feedback about the quality of service provided, however it can sometimes be difficult to ascertain a complete truth when only 2% of those surveyed actually return answers.  
  
Mojo Helpdesk offers a unique feature that allows organizations to gauge customer satisfaction level by rating tickets.  Upon the closing of a ticket, the ticket submitter is asked to rate the level of service they feel they received. The five options range from 'unsatisfied' to 'great job'. Depending on what the ticket submitter chooses, it will apply either 1 to 5 stars to that ticket.  The support tech that worked on the ticket receives a Mojo number based on the average rating of all tickets assigned to them.  With Mojo Helpdesk, support techs can review reports based on their ticket ratings and Mojo number.
