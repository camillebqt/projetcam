We just wanted to mention a few improvements that were made over the last week based on customer feedback andÂ feature requests:

A new filter has been added to the advanced search that allows you to search for tickets that were closed between two date parameters. Using this search filter will mock the 'closed' tickets metric in the Dashboard report.

We improved the time stamp in the event log entries. Now, you can see the actual date and time and on hover, the full date and time.

Lastly, we added the ticket ID numbers to the Time Spent report's export option.
