****After you become used to the Mojo Helpdesk software, you may come across situations where you wish you had a specific feature. No problem, we are here to listen to your suggestions. The smiley face is your window to feedback:

From here, you can click “suggest a feature.” We are constantly improving the product for our users and value any feedback we receive. Our customer community has been an integral part in building Mojo Helpdesk into the product it is today, and there is always room for improvement. Additionally, if you come across any bugs in the software, there is a “report a problem” option as well.



We can't wait to hear your suggestions!
