We recently updated the Mojo Helpdesk API to include two new methods to retrieve user lists: GetAllUsers and GetAgentsAndAbove.  
  
Previously, the only way to call user data via the API was by already knowing the user id or email address.  Now with the new API methods, it is possible to easily obtain a list of users or a list of all staff agents without having to recall the user id or email address.   
  
GetAllUsers will retrieve all users for the accessed account. GetAgentsAndAbove will pull all the users that have technician and above roles for the accessed account.   
  
These new operations are useful for those integrating 3rd party services with Mojo Helpdesk or anybody wanting to retrieve user and staff lists with the API.  
  
Read the [Mojo Wiki](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/blogwiki.metadot.net/faqs/api) for more information about the API.
