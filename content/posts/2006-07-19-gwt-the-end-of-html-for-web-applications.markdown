For those who have missed the start of this quiet revolution, Google is changing the way web applications are developed.  
After rolling out Google maps, Gmail and Google spreadsheet (among many other tools), Google has released its secret sauce: the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). It is a Java development framework that makes writing Rich Internet Applications (understand Ajax applications) a breeze. Best of all it is open source.  
  
It was the missing link. Now we can create web applications that are as powerful as the desktop ones.  
  
We decided to invest some time to explore the advantages and challenges of this framework. The results of our experiment will be posted soon. Let the fun begin.
