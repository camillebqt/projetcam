Metadot is excited to announce an upgrade of Mojo Helpdesk. With a major change in the ticketâ€™s search system, Mojo Helpdesk now provides a high-performance, full-featured search capability. As the number of customers using Mojo grew, we found the previous search system did not scale well. The new search capability means minimal waiting time and increased flexibility in defining search criteria. For example, you can now perform term, phrase, field, Boolean, wild, and fuzzy queries, allowing you to find specific tickets quickly and easily. Search speed is greatly improved, as is Mojo server accessibility.
