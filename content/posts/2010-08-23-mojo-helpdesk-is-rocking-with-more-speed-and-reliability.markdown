Mojo helpdesk has turned it up a notch and our client's feedback has been great. We had a few hiccups (slowdowns) in July but addressed them accordingly; the results we are happy to announce, have been phenomenal.





Why the slowdowns? The good news is that we had a significant surge in new customers recently; the bad news is that it stretched the limits of our infrastructure and caused intermittent slowdowns for our users.





What we did? We spent the better part of July re-architecting the system bottlenecks, concentrating mostly on the database. The work focused on replacing queries that were no longer scalable and also making UI improvements using AJAX technology. Consequently, when a user requests information now, only that specific content is retrieved and displayed.







We have answered the bell with upgrades to our system and now we are ready for the continued growth of our community.
