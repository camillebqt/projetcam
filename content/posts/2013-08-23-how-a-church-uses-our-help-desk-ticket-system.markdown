One of the things we're most proud of is the versatility of Mojo Helpdesk. Businesses can use it to track internal employee requests or customer support requests. Schools can use it to receive and reply to requests from students and faculty. Mojo can also be used to requests in government agencies, non-profits, and churches.


Today we're sharing a story about a church that was kind enough to let us get a closer look into their operations.

We recently caught up with Matt, the IT Director for First Baptist Church Naples to learn more about how his organization uses Mojo Helpdesk.

Here is what Matt had to say.

**ENTER MATT**


### Why does First Baptist Church Naples use Mojo? What kind of requests do you receive through Mojo each day?


First Baptist Church Naples uses Mojo Helpdesk for an internal ticket system for our church and academy. The system allows for issues to be submitted from all of our users via email or the Helpdesk Portal that plugs into our Google Apps domain.


### Describe the results of using Mojo.


Our Tickets can be set up to different Queues (Departments) automatically. So we have three areas that use this system (IT, AVL, and Operations). The initial ability for the ticket creator to assign the ticket to a queue saves us sorting the ticket upfront.

The layout of the Mojo dashboard screens are a more minimalist approach that saves us time on what we are looking at.

Having customizable reports that can be easily retrieved also saves time in viewing open tickets and statuses per department.


### What advice do you have for others who might want to use Mojo for their church's requests? Any workflow or setup suggestions? Where do most of your requests come in from?


We use the tool internally. We are a church of about 4,500 on weekly attendance and we have a Pre-K-12 Academy.

Since a lot of teacher issues can be simultaneous outages, we recommend that our teachers submit emails to their primary offices and then the office assistants submit the ticket so we reduce duplicate tickets.

All of our issues are either submitted to our support email address, which filters nicely to the system, or through the Mojo Helpdesk Google App Portal.


### What's your favorite thing about Mojo?


Most of all, I like the clean layout, the Google Apps integration, and the Saved Searches.
