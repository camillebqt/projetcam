We are glad to release Metadot Rails 7.4.0. The update includes an up-to-ten times increase page rendering speed as well as other goodies such as an upgraded image library that allows registered users to upload images, a setting to prevent oversized image upload, and a 'send this page to a friend' liquid tag.
