Many thanks for your feedback about Mojo Helpdesk. Based on your suggestions, we are happy to announce upgrades have been made and new features have been added.<!-- more -->


### Mojo's faster


We increased speed of the application by optimizing database queries. Most screens are much snappier than before.


### Welcome Email configuration


Now whether your helpdesk sends new users a "Welcome" email is an option you can change in the help desk settings.


### Daily webinars


New to Mojo? Need a quick intro? Take a live 15-min webinar to learn the basics of Mojo or learn how to best configure the helpdesk settings.
