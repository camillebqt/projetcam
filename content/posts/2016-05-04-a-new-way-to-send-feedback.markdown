We added a new, easier way to communicate with our support team from your helpdesk account.  Whether you need to report a problem, request a feature or just send us positive vibes clicking the 'smiley face' at the top of the screen sends your feedback to our helpdesk instantly.

Coming soon, this feature will be available to use for your company's website or app. When you place it on your website or app, your customers will send feedback to your helpdesk instantly. Stay tuned!
