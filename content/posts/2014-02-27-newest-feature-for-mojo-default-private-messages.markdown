Mojo Helpdesk recently developed a new option in the Mojo Helpdesk software that allows users to set their helpdesk to always default to private messages.

Currently Mojo Helpdesk is designed so that when users post a message, their comment is visible to the end user and the end user also receives the 'comment added' email notification for the message. If users want to post a private message they must click the 'private message' option before sending.

Now with this new option, if helpdesk owners would rather have all messages default to private they can configure their helpdesk to do so. Then, if staff wanted a message to be visible to the end user and for the end user to receive the comment added email, they would click the link to make the message public.

To set the helpdesk to default to private messages:

**Go to Manage > All Settings > Configure Mojo Helpdesk > Change > Miscellaneous Settings > 'Default private message?' > Check for "Yes" > Save**

Mojo Helpdesk's philosophy is to keep Mojo as simple as possible for users and not over complicate the app with a bazillion features, yet we like options...so there you have it, a new option to make your helpdesk messages private to the staff.

This is extremely useful for those that are using the helpdesk for internal purposes, or those that have tiered support levels where the 3rd and 2nd tier is not communicating with the end user but the 1st tiered tech is.



Let us know what you think about the new feature and how this will be useful for your workflow!

Thank you,
