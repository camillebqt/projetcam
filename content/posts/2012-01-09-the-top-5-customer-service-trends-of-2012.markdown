The way we do business is changing faster every year as new products and technological breakthroughs influence the expectations and practices of companies of all types.  Awareness of the current and coming customer service trends enables a company to meet customer expectations and leverage the resources available to improve operations from year to year.  
  
With that in mind, we’ve compiled 5 of the top customer service trends of 2012.  
  
**1. Proactive Social Media Use**  
  
People were using social media to vent concerns and complaints about their consumer experiences before businesses really had the wherewithal to develop a presence there themselves; but, more and more, savvy businesses have learned to use social media as a platform to publicly demonstrate personal concern for customer needs and fast response times. In 2012, expect to see more companies treat social media as a two-way communications system offering new, creative opportunities for marketing and customer relationships.  
  
**2. Customer Service in the Cloud**  
  
SaaS (software as a service) products are an increasing presence in the business landscape. Using a customer service software hosted in the cloud lowers costs by moving responsibility for hosting and support out of the company’s hands. It also increases efficiency by bringing all of your customer service needs into one place and speeding up the process of finding relevant data.  
  
**3. Increase in Smartphone Optimized Websites**  
  
As the world gets ever bigger through international internet connections and globalization, the devices we use to view it continue to shrink. With the market for smartphones growing every day, having a mobile optimized version of your website is a must. Businesses should strive to ensure it’s as easy for someone to find the information they need wherever they are with their smartphone as it is for someone sitting in an office.  
  
**4. Self-service Customer Support Gives Way to Faster, Personal Service**  
  
The concept of self-service customer support took off in 2011, with the websites and phone menus of many large companies designed to offer answers to customers without ever connecting them to a representative. While this may save costs by keeping employee numbers down, it also slows down the process of the customer reaching the answer needed and makes the experience less personal. In 2012, companies that prioritize exceptional service are likely to utilize the tools available, such as instant chat functions and [centralized online support desks](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) to help customers faster and with the irreplaceable experience of human care.  
  
**5. Increased Telecommuting**  
  
The availability of easy, affordable technology like Skype, online conferencing products and web-based tools like Mojo Helpdesk makes it possible for more customer service representatives to work from home. The increased flexibility is nice for employees and businesses both and telecommuting allows companies to hire and maintain employment for the highest quality employees in spite of geographical differences.  
  
Each year always has a few surprises when it comes to customer service trends. One company with a solid customer service reputation can do something so amazing it changes our perspectives on good service. In the meantime, we have the means and knowledge to prepare ourselves for those changes that have already begun to take effect and make strides towards ensuring customer satisfaction in new and exciting ways.
