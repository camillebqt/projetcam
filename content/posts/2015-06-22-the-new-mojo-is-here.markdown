It’s finally here! Mojo Helpdesk has been completely redesigned from the ground up with a faster more user friendly experience. The Mojo team didn’t stop there. Behind the scenes, the Mojo gurus have been working to add new features, improve the overall experience, and re-engineer the Mojo Helpdesk app so you can access it on the go.

With the next generation of Mojo, the new and improved experience is so simple that it makes it even easier to connect with customers and manage internal requests.

Existing customers can click 'Try New Mojo' under the Mojo star to use it. New customers will automatically be signed up on the new Mojo Helpdesk.

### New Formula to Calculate Customer Satisfaction (Mojo Number)


Mojo now calculates customer satisfaction by averaging the ratings on tickets over the last 30 days, rather than just the last 30 tickets. This will give a more dynamic reading of your Mojo score.


### User Profile Pictures


Mojo Helpdesk uses your globally recognized avatar as the user profile picture in Mojo Helpdesk. The user just needs to upload their photo to Gravatar and voila, it appears in Mojo.

drop down. This form submits bug tickets straight to us for fast resolution.

### Ticket Close & Lock Feature


We made closing and re-opening tickets easier to manage by moving the close ticket function to the ticket view, away from the other statuses. Now if you need to close or re-open a ticket, it's more intuitive.
