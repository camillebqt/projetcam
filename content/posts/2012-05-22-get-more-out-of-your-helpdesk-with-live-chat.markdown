Between e-mail, phone, texting, social media, live chat, video conferencing and in person meetings, the methods we use to communicate with one another just keep growing. There are many benefits to the modern age of technology, including new ways to approach business and maintain relationships. With so many options available, where’s the best place to start?

[Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) is a versatile tool for communicating with customers and keeping all correspondence efficient and organized. In addition to full e-mail integration and text options, Mojo Helpdesk can also be integrated with live chat services. Live chat software, [HelpOnClick](http://www.helponclick.com/), has put together a step-by-step guide to [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com) with [integrating the service](http://www.helponclick.com/live-chat-software/integration/mojohelpdesk.com.html). By bringing the live chat functionality into the Helpdesk space, companies are able to offer customers more options for communication, while still keeping communication and chat records in one centralized location.

A live chat option for customer support offers the benefit of instant help when they experience a problem. For many customers, the assurance that the company will be there for them whenever needed provides an added level of confidence when making purchasing decisions. For the customer support staff, it offers the extra benefit of ensuring that the correspondence can be logged and referred to at a later date, if needed. A win-win for both sides involved.

Live chat is also a more flexible method of communication, as it allows support team members to perform basic research in the midst of the conversation without skipping a beat. It’s also easy to double check information for accuracy or look up past responses to similar questions before sending a response without slowing down the process. This benefit works both ways, as many customers find it more convenient to use live chat to discuss an issue while at work than making a potentially lengthy phone call.

Utilizing live chat support has several other added benefits as well. International customer language barriers are no longer an issue. Customers are able to type and read at their own pace, making this type of communication much easier than talking on the phone. For younger customers who have grown up with the Internet as a regular part of daily life, online chat is a normal, quick and expected option for communication.

Live chat integration is only one of the many customization possibilities available to [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) users. With the flexibility offered through an open API, [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) users can incorporate as many new ideas and features into their Helpdesks as their creativity and programming abilities allow.
