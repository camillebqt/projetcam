We have recently added a group called 'non-logged in users' to the Queue Access Rights settings. This will allow you to choose which ticket queues and forms users that are not logged in can submit tickets to.

If you are allowing unregistered users to submit tickets, this will help determine what those users can access.

You can set up Queue Access Rights by going to Admin> Queue Access Rights.
