Thank you to all who entered in our [Support Portal Design Contest](http://blog.mojohelpdesk.com/2013/08/help-desk-design-contest.html)! We received entries from an awesome range of organizations from all across the country. Our users are taking advantage of our redesigned portal features such as a custom background and knowledge base.


### Check out our winners below:


**Grand Prize: [MediaSpark](http://mediaspark.mojohelpdesk.com/)**

We loved the tagline "There is a 90% chance that your question is answered below…" and it had a strong theme. They also integrated the Knowledge Base, which was great. Mathew Georghiou received a [full Das Keyboard Prize pack](http://www.daskeyboard.com/), include an awesome keyboard.

This theme has a good incorporation of their logo in the news column area, as well as a relaxing cloud theme. Michael San Filippo received a $50 Amazon gift card for this submission.

** 2nd Place: [Essilor Lab Sales Operations](http://essilorsalesops.mojohelpdesk.com/)**

We liked that the Essilor Ops page incorporated a video and a knowledge base while also featuring one of our custom themes. Dennis Caunce won an office pizza party for sending this in.
