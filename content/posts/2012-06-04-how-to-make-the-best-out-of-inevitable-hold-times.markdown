The only time a customer should be put on hold is when it’s the last resort. This could be when there are more calls coming in than there are people to answer each one, or if additional help is needed to resolve an issue. The challenge is how to keep customers on the line when they are inevitably placed on hold.

Adding music and messages is a great way to make the most of a customers wait time. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing the right audio for your company’s hold time.  
  





### Advantages:








	
  * Music can have a relaxing effect on the customer.

	
  * When customers are actively listening to something on their end, their perception of time seems shorter.

	
  * Businesses can use on hold messages to share promotions or information about the company—possibly inspiring future sales.


 


### Keep in Mind:








	
  * Target audience. Choose music you feel a majority of your customers will enjoy.

	
  * Ad length. Keep ads long enough to include important info, but short enough to keep customers listening.

	
  * Loops. Be weary of excessive repetition, which can end up sounding like a broken record. You don’t want to annoy your customers.

	
  * Cost. Some music is more expensive to purchase than others (some is even free). Though recording audio ads may be expensive, the ads will ideally pay for themselves in future sales.





A [survey](http://www.musicworksforyou.com/background-music/the-impact-of-on-hold-music-for-improving-customer-retention.html) conducted by USA Business Telephone Today found that when on hold, people tend to respond better to music than to silence, and even better to music accompanied by informational messages. 52% of those in the survey hung up after more than one silent minute on hold, as compared to only 13% who had music to listen to, and only 2% that heard music and messages. Notably, the survey also found that the music and messages had a considerable effect on the caller’s perception of the amount of time spent on hold.  All of those faced with silence were convinced that their hold time was longer than it actually was, when less than a fifth of the callers who heard music and messages thought so.




 




Beyond some initial concerns a business may have about utilizing hold music and messaging, it seems clear that any company would do well to invest in using on hold music and messaging. In addition to better call retention rates, the messages heard on hold may lead to new or increased sales. Be as attentive as possible when on the phone with a customer, and when a hold is necessary, strive to make wait time a positive experience. Listen to customer feedback regarding your hold music and messaging, and take these suggestions to heart. As always, pay attention to what the customer wants above all and work to provide it.
