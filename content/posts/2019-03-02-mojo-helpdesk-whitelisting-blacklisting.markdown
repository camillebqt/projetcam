Mojo Helpdesk now supports the ability to Whitelist or Blacklist users in the helpdesk by domain, IP address, or staff IP address.  Whitelisted users will be allowed access to submit tickets and login to the helpdesk and blacklisted users will be blocked from submitting tickets and logging in.

This feature gives Mojo Helpdesk even more compliance in HIPAA and FERPA standards and provides better control to helpdesk admins in deciding which users can access the helpdesk.
