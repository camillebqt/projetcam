Accidents can happen to your data. The key is to be prepared so that if they do occur, it’s easy to undo the damage. Although [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com) provides caution messages where and when mass deletion is about to occur, it is still likely that someone in a hurry might not heed the warning. We wouldn’t want to see Mojo customers accidentally delete a mass of users and all the tickets associated with those users. Recovering from a mistake of this magnitude could be expensive and time consuming, so it’s best to be pro-active and take advantage of the easy export function Mojo Helpdesk offers.

We highly recommend all help desks utilize daily exports to protect their data. It's simple and something that should be added to your daily tasks. To backup your tickets, go to the all settings link at the top of the page.
In order to export the data you'll need at least manager level access to your help desk. From the settings page, select the Export link in the Managers column. You have the option to export all of your helpdesk users, and all the tickets or events by date range.
We recommend you backup everything, but at the least backup your users and tickets. In both cases, once you click the button, you'll be emailed the data you requested. We suggest you keep a file in your email of this data and empty it out monthly. It only takes a minute to do and you'll be grateful you did if you ever have an accident that results in data loss.

Would you like to try our free, [hosted ticket tracking/helpdesk application](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/)? No long-term contracts, signup fees, or termination fees. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime. We offer a [wide variety of plans](http://signup.mojohelpdesk.com/signup) to fit any budget.
