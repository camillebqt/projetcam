Are you responsible for a support team, a certain office location, or a certain project? With [Mojo Helpdesk](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/), you can create custom views so you can keep track of tickets that matter to you. You can filter tickets by keywords, assignees, queues, tags, even custom fields, and more. You can also choose whether to share the view with other agents or to keep the view to yourself.







Watch the video below to find out how you can create custom views from an advanced search.
