The latest Mojo Helpdesk release unveils an improved timer for tracking time spent on tickets.  The timer still automatically tracks the time spent working on tickets but gives you additional functionality of adding or subtracting a specified amount of time in just a few clicks. When replying to a message you can directly input your time on the timer interface without the need to open up timer in edit mode. The timer allows positive or negative values, so if you make a mistake and add too much time you can subtract this easily.  This should help you quickly add remote time you spend working on tickets such as time spent ordering parts, devices or equipment, time spent training or educating users or time spent troubleshooting or repairing hardware or software.

Please give us your thoughts about the improved timer, we would love to hear your feedback.



Thank you,
