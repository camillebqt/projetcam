The Mojo Team wants to bring you our list of favorites. Favorite things for the workplace, for personal growth, favorite help desk jokes (yep, be ready to laugh). Each week we will be sharing our top 5. And this week’s top 5 is our top favorite things to increase happiness in the workplace. Which, as I’m sure you can image, includes a good ol’ fashion ball-pit and much more.



One major goal for many companies is to increase employee productivity. While some companies believe that working longer hours and adding additional workforce to a project may help to increase productivity, others are convinced that the key to increased productivity is the happiness of their employees. Here are some of the top 5 ways to add some fun into the workplace and encourage a happy more productive work environment.




## **Livefyre**




#### **Ping-pong Pause (San Francisco)**


Stressed employees may lose focus as a result, mistakes happen. To avoid that kind of effect, some companies such as Livefyre, decided to set up fun and relaxing place where workers can charge their mind. Lifefyre’s employee can benefit from a ping-pong table by taking time to step away from their projects to reset, take a break, and learn more about each other.

## **Zappos**




#### **Into the Wood (Las Vegas)**


Activities are important for turning a workplace into a fun place, but the environment should also be a priority. The importance of this has been clearly understood by Zappos, the shoe and clothing giant decided to install lots and lots (and lots) of plants in its office. In addition to having more oxygen (which by the way, improves performances of the workers and extends lifespan...hey every little bit helps), it absorbs noises and make the office more beautiful.

## **Pearlfisher**




#### **The Return to Childhood Ball-Pit (London)**


The design company Pearlfisher decided to create an event for its employees since they know how important playing is in the creative process, they wanted to install something impressive and fun that would represent the moment in life during which we play the most : childhood. In the winter of 2014, workers were able to enjoy a giant ball-pit. Yes, a ball-pit! Want to see for yourself? Here’s some [proof of the joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5IVV7dVytM) employees were able to experience.

## **Google**




#### **The Famous Slide-Stairs (Zurich)**


The Google’s offices are known for being incredibly designed with fun around every corner and their way to get downstairs is, of course, a slide. We included it in our top 5 because who doesn’t love a slide?

## **The Mojo Dogs, Yoga, and Tai Chi**


Coming to an office every day where you can bring your four-legged friend is pretty awesome. Our official office dog is Cookie, but we have other visitors daily. It’s always fun when one of the dogs joins us for a meeting or runs to greet you when you get in (tail wagging profusely).  Animals in the workplace make it fun and more relaxing. Mojo also offers weekly Yoga and Tai Chi classes. When you get in one hour of exercise and relaxation, productivity and attention go up. And most importantly, it’s fun.
