### Filter your ticket exports.

**New ticket filters give you added precision in selecting the tickets that appear in your exports. Filter your ticket exports based on ticket submitter, ticket queue, ticket status, due date, and several other conditions. Have the export sent immediately or schedule a recurring export.

To set up an export with filters:

1. Click **new ticket export**
2. Add your filters
3. Click **send now** to send the export immediately to your email.
