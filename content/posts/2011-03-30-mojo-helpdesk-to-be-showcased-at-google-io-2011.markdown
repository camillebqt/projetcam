_The following post is cross-posted from the [Metadot blog](http://blog.metadot.com/2011/03/metadots-www.mojohelpdesk.com/bloghelp-desk-showcased-at.html):_







[Metadot](http://www.metadot.com/) is proud to announce that this year [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) will be showcased at [Google I/O 2011](http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/about.html). Our inclusion was due in part to the November 2010 publication of _[Google App Engine Java and GWT Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Engine-Java-Application-Development/dp/1849690448), _authored by Metadot CEO, Daniel Guermeur. _(Cover art pictured below, click [HERE to order through Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Engine-Java-Application-Development/dp/1849690448))._

For those of you unfamiliar with Google I/O, it's pretty exciting for us geeks. Google I/O, "brings together thousands of developers for two days of deep technical content, focused on building the next generation of web, mobile, and enterprise applications with Google and open web technologies such as Android, Google Chrome, Google APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine and more." ([_taken from the Google I/O webpage_](http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/about.html)).







At [Metado](http://www.metadot.com/)t, our goal is to go beyond cutting edge and be the leaders in our technologies bringing the most up to date products, with the highest-quality, and most efficient services possible. [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) allows businesses to provide the most efficient customer support and service possible, and we're really looking forward to showcasing its features and the technology behind it. More news to come.
