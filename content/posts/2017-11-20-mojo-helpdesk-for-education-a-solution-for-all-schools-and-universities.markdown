Schools of all sizes, Independent School Districts (ISDs), and universities need a seamless and user-friendly help desk software to organize and assign ticket requests. Too often, the search for the right software reveals obstacles: it is hard to implement, requires a big budget and doesn't integrate well with Google G Suite for Education. Mojo Helpdesk is not such a product. Mojo Helpdesk has unmatched simplicity combined with power and is by far [the most cost-effective help desk in the market place](https://www.mojohelpdesk.com/comparison-price/). It integrates with Google G Suite seamlessly. Many schools and universities have benefited from Mojo Helpdesk's stellar features.







While we are working on more extensive case studies, we wanted to share what our education customers really like about Mojo Helpdesk.

Mojo Helpdesk is very easy to set up and use. It's really straightforward and people have no problems using it.

We are a university and we use Mojo Helpdesk to help students, parents, faculty, staff, and vendors with many many different questions and problems.







**Would you recommend Mojo Helpdesk to others and if so, why?**







Yes, I was part of the initial setup and the support from Mojo Helpdesk was wonderful. Also, you can use Mojo Helpdesk for statistical purposes. We realized that by centralizing our help desks on campus by implementing Mojo Helpdesk, our satisfaction rate increased to 99%.

### Austin Community College District, Texas







Mike H. - Director, Campus Technology Services







**What do you like best about Mojo Helpdesk?**







Ease of startup. Authentication was especially easy for Google Apps for Education organizations.







**What problems has Mojo Helpdesk helped you solve?**







Mojo Helpdesk has allowed us to get far more people outside of IT involved. Many tickets cross-organizational boundaries as they are multi-step so Mojo Helpdesk has helped solve that problem.







**Would you recommend Mojo Helpdesk to others and if so, why?**







I would definitely recommend Mojo Helpdesk for price/value, ROI and a very low-risk solution when you might just be in an exploration phase but need something now.

I love how I can customize it to our needs and it is simple to use for technology and the end-user.

It has allowed other departments as well as my own to easily track work orders.

Absolutely, I have told several technology directors about it so far already. Itâ€™s a great product at the right price.
