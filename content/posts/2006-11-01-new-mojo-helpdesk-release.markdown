This new release provides the capability to create tickets from emails.  It is available for all non-free plans. If you have a [Mojo Helpdesk](http://www.mojohelpdesk.com/) account, you can enable it in the Helpdesk Setting page.  
  
We also reformatted the email notification messages to allow a better fit on small-screen devices like pagers, phones and other SMS capable devices.
