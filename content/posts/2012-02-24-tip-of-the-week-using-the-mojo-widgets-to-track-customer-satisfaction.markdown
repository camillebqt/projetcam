The Mojo Number can be very helpful in identifying the team members that are providing superior customer service and the ones that need a bit more mentoring. For support representatives, it provides feedback on their performance.







To make it easier to monitor your Mojo rating, there are 2 different widgets that either place your Mojo Number on your Google Personalized Homepage or your desktop.







**Google Gadget**
The Google Gadget allows staff to place their own Mojo rating on their Google Personalized Homepage. Helpdesk owners can add multiple instances of the gadget to their Google Homepage and use it to monitor their team's satisfaction ratings.










To add the gadget to your Google Personalized Homepage:





	
  1. Click the My Mojo star to go to the My Mojo page.

	
  2. Click the "Add to Google" button on the left side of the page.

	
  3. Then, click the blue "Add Mojo Helpdesk to iGoogle" button, which will take you to your iGoogle page with the Mojo Helpdesk gadget added to it.

	
  4. You'll need to enter your Access Key to connect the widget to your helpdesk account. This can be found on your profile page at the very bottom.

	
  5. Once added, your Mojo Number will be viewable from your iGoogle page.











**Yahoo Widget**

Install the Yahoo Widget if you would prefer to display your Mojo Number on your desktop.



	
  1. Go to [http://widgets.yahoo.com/download/](http://widgets.yahoo.com/download/) to download the Yahoo Widget Engine.

	
  2. Then download the Mojo Helpdesk Widget from Yahoo here: [http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery/view.php?widget=40068](http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery/view.php?widget=40068).

	
  3. Once downloaded, you will need to configure the widget. First enter the URL used to access your helpdesk in the "Domain" field. For example, if you access your helpdesk by visiting: http://my-support.mojohelpdesk.com, that is what you would enter.

	
  4. Enter your access key found in your Mojo Helpdesk user profile into the Access Key field.

	
  5. Now you can view your Mojo Number on your desktop.
