Mojo Helpdesk is happy to announce two helpful features in the latest release: the option to display the Knowledge Base to only logged in users and a new Zapier integration that creates Events for tickets in Google Calendar.

**Private Knowledge Base **

Previously, the Mojo Helpdesk Knowledge Base was a public facing feature that was visible to any user that visited the Help Center Portal. Now, the option exists to only display the Knowledge Base to users that have logged into the Help Center.

This means you can add internal or proprietary articles to your Knowledge Base that are protected behind a login. Company documents, application installment instructions with passwords or HR documents for example, will all be restricted to internal viewing only.

To display the Knowledge Base only to logged in users go to Admin > Settings under the Help Center section and flag the option to display only to logged in users.

**New Zapier Connection to Add Events to Google Calendar**

Mojo Helpdesk released the ability to use a Zap to add Events to Google Calendar based on the scheduled date or due date of a helpdesk ticket.

Adding tickets as events allows you to use the Event notifications to send email reminders or pop-up alerts to notify you of approaching due dates or start dates on Mojo tickets. Adding tickets as Events also allows you to invite others to join on the ticket.

You can create events based on the SLA (service level agreement) due date or even based on the start date of a service ticket or work order.

Creating the Zap is easy and Zapier allows users to create five Zaps on the free plan.
