An internal argument amongst co-workers or departments may not lead to a lost sale or bad review, but it will eventually lead to a negative work environment, compromising the quality of work and productivity of the employees. Unfortunately, unhappy employees cause lost sales and even bad reviews, so how can an organization deliver spectacular internal support and keep the workflow, well, flowing?

The same features that make Mojo Helpdesk an invaluable customer service tool are also useful in enabling employees to effectively communicate internally. Employees can raise tickets for work items or future tasks and assign them to the appropriate staff member or department to resolve.  Correspondence between employees or departments is tracked in a discussion-like thread on the ticket and email notifications update staff in real-time. With Mojo, it’s easy for any employee to view the progress of tickets and take over if necessary. When internal support requests follow the same guidelines as delivering excellent customer support, internal requests are given the extra effort and priority they deserve.

Businesses that use an open-communications/tracking tool will see improvements at every level. When employees communicate efficiently, they will make sure no task falls through the cracks, and work ethics are likely to improve. Your business will be more successful with a little extra effort towards the improvement of internal operations, leading to improved customer relationships as well as employee relationships.
