Mojo Helpdesk has added the capability of integrating with Azure Active Directory. This means anyone who is a member in an Active Directory account can use their Active Directory credentials to login to the company's Mojo Helpdesk using Single Sign On (SSO).

There are two different ways SSO can be initiated:

First,  users are able to login to the Mojo Helpdesk account using Active Directory SSO (Single Sign On) by simply clicking "Login with Azure AD" from the helpdesk's login page.

Second, if Mojo Helpdesk is added to the Active Directory (AD) as an Application, users logged into AD are able to click on the Mojo Helpdesk tenant and access the helpdesk directly.
