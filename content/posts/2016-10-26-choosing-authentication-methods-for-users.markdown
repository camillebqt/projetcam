Mojo Helpdesk now allows you to choose which authentication methods are able to be used from the help center login page.

For example, if you use Google Apps for Education you can configure the settings to only display the Google SSO login option to the user. Â Or, if you only use Active Directory then you can display the Active Directory login option alone. If your users have both you can display both options.

Conversely, you may not want users logging in with their Gmail or Active Directory accounts. In this case, you can choose to display only the Mojo system login option.

A helpdesk admin can choose which authentication methods to display by going to Admin > Helpdesk Configuration.
